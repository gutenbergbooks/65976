  "<i>Theirs not to reason why;<br />
  Theirs but to do and die.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Many people have asked me about the Russian
campaign, why American soldiers went to Siberia, and
what they did after they got there, for the general notion
seems to be that Russia and Siberia are synonymous, and
that the Russian Expedition, whatever its hazy purpose
was, was centered about Vladivostok, and that in this far
eastern port, a few American and Allied soldiers "marked
time," while their comrades on the Western Front fought
out, and eventually conquered, in the greatest of all wars.
</p>

<p>
One American officer was actually ordered to join his
command at Archangel, "via Vladivostok," and the order
was issued by the War Department of the United States.
Six thousand miles of inaccessible territory separated these
two Russian ports, and the average American soldier who
went out from Archangel in the fall of 1918, and, during
the desolate winter months that followed, fought for his
life along the Vologda railway, or far up the Dvina river,
or in the snows of Pinega and Onega valleys, never knew
that Brigadier General William S. Graves of the United
States army, with thirteen hundred eighty-eight regulars
and forty-three officers, had landed at Vladivostok on 4th
September, 1918, and remained there after the Archangel
fiasco had terminated.  There was no conscious liaison
between this American company of the far East and that of
the far North, each performing burlesque antics in fantastic
sideshows, while in the West, the greatest drama of all
time was in its denouement, and a tense world trembled
as it watched.
</p>

<p>
Whether there was any political connection between
the Archangel Expedition and the Vladivostok Expedition
is for the statesmen to answer.  Surely there never was
any military connection.  Obviously, there never could be
any support or communication between the two forces, and
the American soldier at the Arctic Circle who was not told
the reasons why he faced death and unknown dangers there,
and why he was weakened and broken, and made old by
privation and intense cold, never knew that there was a
Siberian Expedition, and does not know even to this day.
</p>

<p>
So I have thought it worth while to tell, as faithfully
as I could, the story of this strange war of North Russia,
an insignificant flickering in the glare of the mighty world
conflict, but inspiring in its human significance, its exploits
of moral strength and sheer resolution and godlike courage.
I have considered the campaign as a trial by ordeal of
American manhood, that tested our souls to the depths, like
Gallipoli tested the British.  It was like Gallipoli in the
hopeless odds encountered at every turn, in the vague
outline of the commitment at the outset; in its distressing
losses; its hardships and privations; its tragical ending.
</p>

<p>
But it was very vitally unlike Gallipoli, because in the
war with Russia the soldier never knew why.  The Australians,
in their effort to force the Dardanelles, were exalted
by the belief that theirs was an important operation in the
war, and the British soldier went to battle the Turks,
convinced that if he died, it was to save some little spot in a
Cheshire or Sussex village, which to him meant England.
It was a holy war, and men were fired with the high,
selfless devotion of the Crusaders.  An arrogant, brutal
power swaggered abroad, menacing liberty, and the home
and all things of the spirit.  If German Imperialism
engulfed civilization, there would be nothing left to live for
anyway.
</p>

<p>
But there were no such reflections to sustain the soldier
in Russia.  The Armistice came, and he remembers the day
as one of sanguinary battle, when his dwindling numbers
suffered further grievous losses, and he was sniped at,
stormed with shrapnel and shaken by high explosive shells.
He heard of the cessation of blood-letting in France and
Belgium, but for many desolate, despairing months, he stood
to his guns, witnessing his comrades killed and mutilated,
the wounded lying in crude, dirty huts, makeshifts of
dressing stations, then in sledges, dragged many excruciating
miles over the snow to the rear, where often they got little
better attention than at the front lines.  He knew his
physical strength was failing under the unrelieved monotony
of the Arctic exploration ration; he saw others with scabies
and disgusting diseases of malnutrition, and wondered how
long before he too would be in the same way.  He felt his
sanity reeling in the short-lived, murky, winter days, the
ever encircling menace of impending disaster and
annihilation.  He asked his officers why he fought, and why he was
facing an enemy vastly superior to him in strength and
equipment and armament, and why he was separated from
his family and home and the ways of life, and when the
end would come.  But his officers were silent under this
inquisition.  They asked the same questions themselves, and
got no reply.  The colonel who commanded this fated regiment
told his soldiers that he could give no reason for them
to oppose the enemy other than that their lives and those
of the whole expedition depended upon successful resistance.
</p>

<p>
So soldierlike, he "carried on," while the dreary skies
above him menaced death, and death stalked the encompassing
forests of the scattered front lines, and the taint of
death was in the air he breathed.
</p>

<p>
In the end, and when nearly all hope had fled, he
returned homeward, stricken in health and dazed in spirit,
where people moved as before, and were agitated by the
same concerns, as if nothing had occurred to upset the whole
scheme of things and uproot forever the old standards of
values and ambition and morality.  They noticed a queer
look in his eyes and that he was customarily silent, often
introspective.  They manifested a casual interest in his great
adventure.  They never could understand.
</p>

<p>
Both expeditions were conceived by the British High
Command and both were conducted by the execution of
British military orders.  Perhaps therein is the underlying
philosophy of North Russia and Gallipoli; this attachment
of the British mind to an astricted faith in England and
her imperial destiny to rule the peoples of the world,
contemptuous of obstacles and difficulties and perils in
unknown, alien lands that appear very real to other than
British mental processes.
</p>

<p>
"We'll just rush up there and re-establish the great
Russian army&mdash;reorganize the vast forces of the Tsar," said
an ebullient officer in England, wearing the red tabs and
hatband of the General Staff.  "One good Allied soldier
can outfight twenty Bolsheviks," was the usual boast of the
Commanding Officer in the early days of the fighting.
</p>

<p>
And it was a boast that was made good in the furious
winter combats, when, standing at bay, the scattered companies,
with no place to retreat, save the open snow, stood
off many times their number of the enemy.  In these decisive
trials, the spirit of the Anglo-Saxon ever asserted its
superiority, but one to twenty is not a very comfortable ratio
upon which to form an offensive campaign.  And the war
against Russia was conceived as an offensive campaign,
whatever it turned out to be.

RUSSIA THE VAST UNKNOWN

"The Emperor fully realized the nature of the task
he had before him.  To defend himself in Italy,
Germany or even Poland against the Tsar was one thing;
to invade the vast empire of Russia, was another task
altogether&mdash;a task colossal, if not appalling.  And
arrayed against him were two fearful enemies&mdash;the
Russian Army and winter."

RUSSIA THE VAST UNKNOWN
</p>

<p>
Sometimes we are amused by foreign littérateurs and
commentators, who come to our great country for a
few crowded weeks of teas and symposia, gatherings of the
intelligencia in our metropolis, and perhaps a dash into the
mushroom dilettantism of Chicago, to set sail and compose
screeds and screeds of America, her ways and her people,
their manners and their customs.
</p>

<p>
Superficial vaporings, but far better composed and built
by far on firmer ground than the idle opinions of those few
Americans who have gone to the vast, far stretching empire
of the Slavs, and glibly vouchsafed their ex cathedra views
thereon.
</p>

<p>
The dominions of Great Russia were spread from the
Baltic east to the Japan Sea, and from above the Arctic
Circle far south to the Caspian and the Black Sea and Lake
Baikal in Siberia.  They comprised eight million six
hundred and fifty thousand square miles of varied territory,
nearly three times that of the United States, and were
peopled by heterogeneous people, numbering one hundred and
eighty million, as estimated, for no census or even
approximate count has ever been attempted.
</p>

<p>
There were the Finns and the Letts, the Lithuanians, the
Jews, the Mordvinians, the Estonians, the Siberians, the
Great Russians, the Little Russians, the Red Russians, and
the White Russians of the Central Provinces, the Cossacks
of the south, and the Tartars of the Caucasus; all with no
conscious unity, no national identity, not a single common
impulse or purpose or interest.  In many instances, without
a communion of language.
</p>

<p>
The total length of railways in 1917 was thirty-four
thousand miles, or less than one-eighth of that of our
country.  Of these one hundred and eighty million Russians,
nearly eighty per cent are moujiks, docile, patient
serfs, liberated scarcely sixty years ago by Alexander II,
and still shackled by the shackles of their serfdom, woeful
ignorance, cowed spirit and afflicting poverty.
</p>

<p>
The remaining twenty per cent are survivors of the fading
nobility and the bourgeoisie, or middle class, who have
acquired wealth and consequent social rank without claim
to nobility of birth.  These last are hated with an intense,
irrational hatred by the Bolsheviki.
</p>

<p>
The noble class, the Russian of Turgenev, supersensitive,
highstrung, supercultivated, almost to the point of degeneration,
is fast vanishing with the passing of the last vestige
of the Romanoff regime, and soon will be a thing of the
past.  This intolerant caste for centuries had dwelt in
idleness on great landed estates.  It was as alien to the poor
moujik as if of an entirely distinct race.  I met a few of
these highborn on the streets of Archangel, whence they
had fled from the murderous Reds in the cities of Moscow
and Petrograd.  Elegant gentlemen they were, in all the
glittering panoply of Imperial army officers, and manners
the extreme in politesse; very pompous, extremely impressive.
They did not conceal their contempt of the crawling
moujik; he was a swine, and when the word was hissed in
Russian, it sounded very swinish.
</p>

<p>
The serf and the highborn, the swaggering, objectionable
bourgeoisie, the moujik and his animal ignorance, the
intelligencia, and his superculture, each separated from the
other by an abysmal unspanable gulf; and the various
Russian races so dissimilar in thought and living, in customs,
even in language, all nevertheless were kept in some
semblance of cohesion by the brutal, disciplinary methods
of the Tsar and the cooperating spiritual guidance of the
Russian State Catholic Church, of which the Tsar was the
Little Father.
</p>

<p>
San Francisco is as acutely conscious of national affairs
in Washington, as New York, and more so.  But this is
because the finest transportation system in the world makes
it possible to journey from one city to the other in a few
days, and because every American is an ardent disciple of
our great public press.
</p>

<p>
But Vladivostok knows nothing of Petrograd, and Petrograd
knows little of Archangel, and in the little villages,
where the people live, the world beyond is clothed in
impenetrable mystery; for there are no railways to these
villages.  No news comes in, and if news came, there are few
among the moujiks who could read it.
</p>

<p>
It is well to keep these things in mind when men speak
of Russia, as if overnight it could formulate a concerted
policy and engage in a purpose backed by preponderant
control of the Russian people.  Russia is not a nation, it is
an immense, unwieldy empire, a giant of tremendous
strength, with undreamt-of potentialities, capable of
colossal deeds, but without authoritative, united control or
direction; entirely unconscious of any national entity.
</p>

<p>
When Nicholas abdicated in March, 1917, it was an
anxious world that viewed the experimental government
of Prince Lvoff.  Russia was an important ally, but she
had made heroic sacrifices and had lost five millions of men;
if she faltered now, the world might be lost.  And there
were rumors of a separate peace.
</p>

<p>
A few months after the downfall of the Tsar, Kerensky,
as Premier, issued a manifesto expressing undying allegiance
to the sacred cause of the Allied Nations, and shortly
delivered to the army his famous Prikaz, which:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
a.  Abolished the penalty of death for disobedience of
essential military discipline.
</p>

<p>
b.  Abolished soldierly courtesy and the salute.  Officers
were henceforth to be known as tvarishi, comrades, and all
social distinctions between them and the common soldier
were abrogated.
</p>

<p>
c.  Meetings of soldiers to discuss the conduct of military
affairs were permitted.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Officers were simply unmanned of any effective authority.
They were permitted to administer and instruct their
organization, but all disciplinary measures were passed upon by a
committee of soldiers, and so obedience to any order was a
matter for ultimate ruling by such a soldier committee and
not by an officer.  This was democracy run riot, individual
liberty gone stark mad.  A few weeks after Kerensky took
command, one million five hundred thousand Russian
soldiers, grown weary of the tedium and the hazards of the
front, quit the army and returned to their homes.
</p>

<p>
Thus by one foolhardy, ill-advised measure, an army became
a rabble.  Discipline, as essential to the military as
blood is essential to sustain a physical body, vanished, and
the collapse of Russia began with Kerensky.

April, 1917, President Wilson was uneasy about Russia
and her future course against the common enemy.  Emissaries
were therefore sent to learn of conditions first hand.
Headed by the Honorable Elihu Root, as Ambassador
Extraordinary, these reached Petrograd on the 13th June,
1917.  Charles P. Crane, Cyrus H. McCormick of Illinois,
and General Scott, the American Chief of Staff,
accompanied Mr. Root.  The emissaries met Kerensky, talked
with several military and labor leaders, attended many
banquets, made as many good speeches, and reported to the
President in Washington on 12th August of the same year.
</p>

<p>
This report was made in confidence to the President, and
even at the late date of the present writing, all requests to
examine it have been denied by the State Department, on
the grounds that "Divulgence is incompatible with the
public interests."
</p>

<p>
But shortly afterwards, Mr. Root gave out an interview,
which purported to express the views of the delegation:
that they had come back with faith in Russia; faith in
Russian qualities of character that are essential tests of
competency and self government; faith in the purpose, the
persistence and the power of the Russian people to keep
themselves free.
</p>

<p>
Many American bankers, believing in Mr. Root, manifested
kindred faith by the exchange of good American dollars
for Russian rubles, despite the fact that the Russian
government was hopelessly bankrupt and was showing an
operating deficit of milliards of rubles.
</p>

<p>
General Scott visited the Russian front and witnessed
the offensive which resulted in the taking of Kovel and
Lemberg.  He conferred with Generals Brussiloff, Korniloff,
and Erdeli and their staffs, and reported to the American
Secretary of War that Russia would stay in the war
"if given even a part of the aid she asks."
</p>

<p>
Three months before the debacle, the Secretary of State,
Mr. Lansing, assured the American people that Russia was
stronger than she had been for some time, both from the
government point of view and the military point of view.
</p>

<p>
The government point of view?  The outstanding
feature of the Russian Government "point of view" has
always been the venal disposition of the High Command;
the shameful, heartless, conscienceless corruption of persons
in authority.  Everyone knew this who knew Imperial
Russia.  At the trial of General Sukhomlinov, Minister for
War, General Yanushkevitch, former Chief of Russian
General Staff, testified that in the retreat from Galicia,
during the summer of 1915, there was only one rifle for every
ten soldiers.  The soldiers in the rear had to wait until their
comrades on the firing line were killed so that they might
have their rifles.  The Russians had no shells, and the
Germans knowing this, set their guns two thousand yards
off and shot down one helpless regiment after the other.
</p>

<p>
Many other examples of pitiful defenselessness could be
cited at a time when the Allies loaned hundreds of millions
of dollars to Russia for arms and military equipment, and
Russia had these munitions, but far back of the front lines.
</p>

<p>
We have viewed Russian affairs as we have viewed Mexico,
with American provincial eyes instead of attempting to
judge from a Russian angle.  Gladstone said that a nation
guided by provincial statesmen was doomed for perdition,
and, by reason of our provincialism, American statecraft
striving to cope with Russia was hopelessly handicapped at
the outset.  This wholesale scandal and shameless corruption
in high circles was typically Russian, an essential
premise upon which to form a judgment of the Russian
situation, but a premise totally unknown to persons
unfamiliar with Russian character and Russian conditions.
</p>

<p>
Democracy assumes intelligence, but most important of
all, self-control.  Had we been familiar with the Russian
people, is it likely that our State Department would have
given such unstinted confidence to the dreamer, Kerensky?
For like all countries where ignorance stifles the progress
of struggling national life a strong unhesitant hand was
needed to guide the nascent Russian democracy, and instead
of resolution Kerensky presented oratory and by his Prikaz
and vacillating policies rapidly lost his grip upon the army.
General Korniloff attempted to rally the demoralized forces,
restored the death penalty and strove to bring out of the
chaos created by Kerensky, some likeness of coordination,
but there was a division in adherence to the Premier and the
General, and in the end both Korniloff and Kerensky failed.
Probably no man could have succeeded; the seeds of
destruction had germinated and struck root.  It was too late.
</p>

<p>
The revolution of the Bolsheviks took place on 7th
November, 1917, and in February following was announced
the Peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, whereby the provinces of
Russian Poland, Courland, Lithuania, and Estonia came
under German control, giving Germany an important Baltic
littoral.  Turkey, the ally of Germany, was to receive back
all territory in Asia Minor occupied since the war, and in
addition the districts of Kars and Erivan and Batum.
Germany and Turkey controlled the Caucasus, the boundaries
of which were to be restored as they existed before the
Russian-Turkish War of 1877.  During the civil war that
followed in the Ukraine, the Germans occupied the port of
Sevastopol, and the Austrians took Odessa.  Germany got
vast stores of guns and war material, thirteen thousand
three hundred fifty miles of railway, more than one-third
of the entire Russian rail system, a large amount of rolling
stock, seventy-three per cent of Russian iron fields and
eighty-nine per cent of her coal.
</p>

<p>
The war in the East was over, one hundred and forty-seven
German and Austrian Divisions were released for the
Western Front.

OBJECTS OF THE EXPEDITION
</p>

<p>
It is said of the Bolsheviks, that they are a terrorist,
minority party, rode to power by the seizure of every
available machine gun in Russia and maintain their sway
by the same forceful persuasion.
</p>

<p>
One of the <i>intelligencia</i> once told me, that of every
hundred Russians, only two were Bolsheviks, and the remaining
ninety-eight were cowed into submission by the methods
of the desperado.
</p>

<p>
This, to enlightened, high-spirited America is a preposterous
statement, but Russia is not America.  Nor has she
America's schools, nor America's great railways, nor the
public press of America.
</p>

<p>
At Brest-Litovsk, Russia was stripped of nearly all war
supply and munitions by the unsparing Germans, and what
was left was seized by the belligerent Soviets.
</p>

<p>
Now, even in proud America, a resolute man back of a
six shooter has been known to hold up an entire train load
of people.  And whether the Soviets are backed by the
sanction of the masses, or whether as the Imperialists would
have us believe, they are an unprincipled, bullying minority,
they are in truth and fact the de facto government and
represent the sovereignty of Russia in the comity of nations.
</p>

<p>
For six years Lenine and Trotsky have ruled, while the
ministries of America, France, England and Italy have
undergone complete transformation with the changing
judgments of these troublous times, and now, begrudgingly,
Russia; Russia of the Soviet Party, proletarian Russia,
anarchistic, "nihilistic" Russia is given a seat at the
international conference table of Lausanne, Great Britain has
officially recognized the Soviets, and clamorous politicians
in this country (even one statesman), are emphatically
demanding recognition by the United States.
</p>

<p>
The Bolsheviks derived their inspiration from the Russian
anarchist, Bakunin, an apostle of terror and violence.
Bolshevik comes from the Russian word <i>bolshinstvo</i>, the
majority.  The name was used for the first time in 1903,
when Nicolai Lenine split the Social Democratic party in
two and assumed leadership of the majority.  Lenine's real
name was Zederblum, that of Trotsky, Bronstein.
</p>

<p>
The moving purpose of Bolshevism is to organize a great
international revolution, affecting all countries.  A revolution
that will eradicate forever the hated capitalist class, and
the despised small proprietors and entrepreneurs, known as
bourgeoisie.  Bolshevism is openly an enemy of democracy.
It has no tolerance for any class save the proletarian.  In
the Bolshevik era, only the proletariat has any claim.
Bolshevism is autocracy, autocracy of the proletariat.  A
ruthless autocracy that would utterly destroy every social group
except this favored one.
</p>

<p>
Directly he assumed power, Lenine put into effect the
Land Decree, which abolished the title of landlords to real
estate and confiscated all landed estates, except the small
holdings of the peasants.  All employers of labor were
suppressed, the six-hour day was established in industrial
enterprises, and all employees were to have a voice in the
management.
</p>

<p>
There is naught in this program which can be reconciled
with German Imperialism, yet many statesmen and soldiers
in Allied councils were convinced that an alliance existed
between the Bolsheviks and Germany.  But it is impossible
to conceive of two more extreme opponents in political
philosophy, for the Prussian Junkers believed devoutly in
the divine commission of kings, as enunciated by the Kaiser
himself; and the Bolsheviks, hating every suggestion of
imperialism with an intense, raging hatred, threatened
death to every king, and recognized, as qualified to rule or
govern, none save the proletariat.
</p>

<p>
Only one tenet did Bolshevism and Prussian militarism
have in common, i.e., they were both invincibly opposed
to democracy.  Both archenemies of political justice, as we
Americans understand political justice.
</p>

<p>
The military leaders and statesmen at Berlin beheld with
serious alarm the Revolution of November, 1917.  They
loathed the Bolsheviks and feared the effect of their
insidious propaganda on the German masses.  The German
Chancellor, Von Bethmann, was obsessed with the fear of
Bolshevism, and Ludendorff writes bitterly of the grave error
in failing to crush the Soviet Party and to openly take sides
with its opponents in Russia.  He speaks of the lowered
morale of the Eastern German Divisions; how several of
them proved utterly worthless in the battles of France, as
a consequence of coming in contact with the Bolsheviks;
how the Bolshevik revolutionary ideas corroded the spirit
of the people at home, and had more to do, than the
military defeat, with the downfall of the German Government.
</p>

<p>
And the Soviet leaders returned the venom of Berlin
with even greater virulency.  They denounced the
Brest-Litovsk agreement, stigmatizing it as: "The rape of
Russia," and in their propaganda repeatedly expressed
imperishable hatred of the German Imperialists.  Lenine
withdrew from the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk on 11th
February, 1918, and refused to accede to the harsh demands
of Germany.  Thereupon, the Ukraine was immediately
invaded, and on 1st March, the Germans occupied Kiev, the
capital, holding a line to Reval on the Gulf of Finland,
through Estonia, Pskov, Vilebsk and Mogilev.  The helpless
Russians could do nothing but submit, and under duress
signed the treaty on 3rd March, 1918.
</p>

<p>
Still has it been affirmed by Allied statesmen time and
repeatedly that the Bolsheviks were a willing party to the
Brest-Litovsk pact, and that Moscow and Berlin were
conspiring for the destruction of all Western civilization.
</p>

<p>
In his Fourteen Point address to Congress on 8th January,
1918, President Wilson expressed deep sympathy with
Russia and enunciated Point VI as one of the cardinal
principles for which the Allies fought:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
VI.  The evacuation of all Russian territory and such
a settlement of all questions affecting Russia as will secure
the best and freest cooperation of the other nations of the
world in obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed
opportunity for the independent determination of
her own political development and national policy, and
assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free
nations under institutions of her own choosing; and, more
than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that she may
need and may herself desire.  The treatment accorded
Russia by her sister nations in the months to come will be
the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of
her needs as distinguished from their own interests.

<p>
On 11th March, 1918, on the eve of its meeting to pass
upon the question of the acceptance or rejection of the
Brest-Litovsk terms, the President sent a message of friendship to
the all Russian Congress of Soviets, which contained this
pledge:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
Although the government of the United States is unhappily
not now in a position to render the direct and effective
aid it would wish to render, I beg to assure the people
of Russia, through the Congress, that it will avail itself
of every opportunity to secure for Russia once more
complete sovereignty and independence in her own affairs and
full restoration in her great role in the life of Europe and
the modern world.  The whole heart of the people of the
United States is with the people of Russia in the attempt
to free themselves forever from autocratic government and
become masters of their own life.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Many contend that if the Allies had stood by the de
facto government of Russia, as President Wilson's words
gave promise of doing, the disastrous treaty would never
have been accepted.
</p>

<p>
Questions have been addressed to the then American
Secretary of State asking: Did the administration know at
the time of the Brest-Litovsk negotiations:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
1.  That the Soviet government represented by Lenine
and Trotsky was opposed to the projected treaty and signed
it only because of the physical impossibility of resisting
German demands unless some of the Allies came to its aid?
</p>

<p class="quote">
2.  That Lenine and Trotsky gave a note to Colonel
Raymond Robbins of the Red Cross, stating to the President
of the United States that they were opposed to the treaty
and would not sign if the United States would give food
and arms to the Russians?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The reply of Mr. Lansing was that answers to these
questions were not compatible with the public interest.
</p>

<p>
On 12th December, 1918, Senator Johnson asked this
question in the United States Senate:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
Is it true that the British High Commissioner, sent to
Russia after the Bolsheviki revolution because of his
knowledge and experience in the Russian situation, after four
months in Russia, stated over his signature that the Soviet
government had cooperated in aiding the Allies, and that
he believed that <i>intervention in cooperation with the Soviet
government was feasible as late as the fifth of May, 1918</i>?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
No spokesman for the administration, or anyone else,
ever answered or attempted to answer this question.
</p>

<p>
After Brest-Litovsk, it was generally believed that the
ambitions of Germany in Russia were:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
1.  To recruit her war wasted divisions from the great
number of Austrian and German prisoners in Russia.
</p>

<p>
2.  To exploit the great natural resources of the Ukraine,
Courland, Lithuania and Estonia.
</p>

<p>
3.  To align on her eastern frontier buffer states from
Finland to the Caucasus with Persia as the last link in the
chain.
</p>

<p>
4.  To seize great stores of war munitions at Archangel
and Vladivostok.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There was also some credence in the rumor that Germany
sought to establish submarine bases at Murmansk and
Petchenga in Finland.
</p>

<p>
Murmansk, on the Kola Peninsula, is the only port of
North Russia not closed for nearly half the year.  During
the months of winter, from December until the middle of
June, Archangel, Kem, Onega and Kandalaksh on the
White Sea are sealed by effective barriers of ice, and even
Petrograd, several hundred miles further south on the
Baltic, is closed until late in April.  But the Cape current of
the Gulf Stream swings around the northern coast of the
Kola Peninsula, and at Murmansk there is an excellent
natural harbor, which is always open, with thirty-two feet
of water in shore, and a high coast line, giving splendid
protection against storm.  From this valuable ice free port,
the Murman railway extends three hundred miles to Kem
and continues through Petrozavodsk on the west shore of
Lake Onega, six hundred miles further to Petrograd.
</p>

<p>
The completion of this, the most northern railroad, is
a triumph of imagination and courage and invincible
resolution.  The Russian engineer, Goriatchkovshy, inspired by
the necessity of his country having a means of inlet for
munitions and supplies during the war (for the Trans-Siberian
railway could carry only about one-seventh of such
supplies), laid the tracks over seemingly bottomless tundra
and conquered in the face of most disheartening discouragements.
</p>

<p>
A great number of German prisoners and one hundred
thousand Russian laborers worked to complete the heroic
enterprise.  Experts predicted that with the melting of the
ice in spring, the tracks would disappear in the marshes,
but Goriatchkovshy had reckoned with the elements.  The
Murman railway is operating today.  It has a hauling
capacity of thirty-five hundred tons a day, the maximum
handling facilities of Murmansk port, and many a lonely
soldier, snowbound in North Russia, during the tragic
winter of 1919, has the Murman railway and its creator,
Goriatchkovshy, to thank for the messages from far off America,
that came to Murmansk and were brought to Archangel
by Obozerskaya on the Vologda railway, and then relayed
by droshky and the faithful Russian pony to a solitary
sentinel post somewhere in the great white reaches of the
interior.
</p>

<p>
Very close to the Murman road is Finland, which,
because of its remoteness from the Russian capital, had
always exercised a limited autonomy, and following the
Kerensky Revolution of March, 1917, announced by the action
of the Finnish Diet, its complete independence.
</p>

<p>
A civil war between Red Guards and White Guards for
the control of the government followed.  It was no secret
that from the beginning of the European war the
sympathies of the Finns were with Germany, and now at the
outbreak of this internal conflict in Finland, Germany
aligned with the White Guards against the revolutionary
Reds who were supported by the Bolsheviks.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of April, 1918, three regiments of
German rifles, two batteries and three battalions of Jagers,
under General von der Goltz, landed at Hanko, and,
cooperating with the White Finns, suppressed the
revolutionists, took possession of the port Viborg and were in
control of railway communication to Petrograd.  But this
small expeditionary force never left the southern part of
Finland, and in August, when every German was needed
in France, the greater part of it left for the Western Front.
</p>

<p>
The campaign in Finland had no effect on the course of
the war.  Its significance was unduly magnified by both
sides.
</p>

<p>
It was a firm conviction in Allied Councils that the
Germans had immense forces in Finland, while the German
Imperial Staff thought that the insignificant hundreds that
the British landed at Murmansk in April, almost at the
same time that the Germans entered the south of Finland,
were in large numbers, perhaps several Divisions.
</p>

<p>
Thus there existed a blindman's buff in Finland; both
Commands in startling ignorance of enemy salient facts,
which is often the case in the game of war where "uncertainty
is the essence"; each supposed the other was actively
engaged in "recreating an Eastern Front," which, in
concrete application, meant the recruiting of hundreds of
thousands of Russians to press on from the East and fill in the
war-wasted gaping ranks of Germany or the Allies.
</p>

<p>
To effect this object and gain access to the interior of
Russia, the Murman railway, therefore, assumed a
momentous significance; but in truth the "Eastern Front"
remained a figment of the military imagination.  Russia had
poured out the life blood of her sons in the Allied defense
till she staggered weak and exhausted, so spent that she
swayed in a moral lethargy from which nothing on earth
could arouse her, and those Russian soldiers who survived
returned to their villages or else were conscripted for the
Red army by the amazingly effective methods of Trotsky.
</p>

<p>
Still, in the spring of the year 1918, the situation in
Finland appeared so fraught with grave potentialities of
decisive consequence, that on 27th May, the Allied
military attaches of Italy, France, England and the United
States met at Moscow and unanimously agreed that these
nations should intervene in the affairs of Russia.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after this, the Supreme War Council at Versailles
decided in favor of intervention in the northern Russian
ports, and the United States gave its consent.
</p>

<p>
Brigadier General F. C. Poole had been in Petrograd
in command of the technical war mission of the British in
Russia.  Thoroughly familiar with Russian character and
Russian conditions, he was chosen to command the
Northern Expedition.
</p>

<p>
The advance party of the Americans landed in Archangel
on 3rd August, 1918.  On the same day, this statement
was cabled to the Russian Ambassador from the State
Department at Washington:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
In the judgment of the government of the United States,
a judgment arrived at after repeated and very searching
considerations of the whole situation, military intervention
in Russia would be more likely to add to the present sad
confusion there than to cure it, and would confuse rather
than help her out of her distresses, as the government of
the United States sees the present circumstances, therefore
military action is admissible in Russia now only to render
such protection and help as is possible to the Czecho-Slovaks
against the armed Austrian and German prisoners who are
attacking them, and to steady any efforts at self-government
or self-defense in which Russians themselves may be
willing to accept assistance.  Whether from Vladivostok or
from Murmansk and Archangel, the <i>only present object
for which American troops will be employed will be to
guard military stores</i> which may be subsequently needed
by Russian forces, and to render such aid as may be
acceptable to the Russians in the organization of their own
defense.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The importance of guarding the Arctic ports from the
Germans passed with the signing of the Armistice, but
armed intervention continued, and the most sanguinary
battles in North Russia were fought in the dark winter months
that followed.
</p>

<p>
When the last battalion set sail from Archangel, not a
soldier knew, no, not even vaguely, why he had fought or
why he was going now, and why his comrades were left
behind&mdash;so many of them beneath the wooden crosses.
The little churchyards and the white churches and the
whiter snow!  Life will always be a crazy thing to the
soldier of North Russia; the color and the taste of living
have gone from the soldier of North Russia; and the glory
of youth has forever gone from him.
</p>

<p>
It is a fearful thing to contemplate the deliberate
taking of a life.  All consciousness recoils at the dreadful,
irretrievable consequences of murder; yet when nations
engage in extensive killing, there is no malice in the act on
the part of individuals.  Killing then has an impersonal
character and becomes an heroic contemplation.
</p>

<p>
In Western trenches, the enemy was called "Jerry" in
a spirit of grotesque comradery and sportsmanship, and
the finest soldiers had little hatred in their hearts for those
across the twisted, shell gashed acres, who sought to maim
and kill them, but with no malice aforethought.
</p>

<p>
The mildest men, and men of highest culture and intelligence,
recently made a profession of killing, and could
practice their newly found profession with keen, cold,
ghoulish precision and the comprehensive analysis of trained
minds.  War is not murder, and the business of killing
loses its infamy and much of its obscenity by the united
impulse of millions striving with selfless purpose, pure
devotion and heroic sacrifice for a nation's goal.  War shears
from a people much that is gross in nature, as the merciless
test of war exposes naked, virtues and weaknesses alike.
But the American war with Russia had no idealism.  It
was not a war at all.  It was a free-booter's excursion,
depraved and lawless.  A felonious undertaking, for it had
not the sanction of the American people.
</p>

<p>
During the winter of 1919, American soldiers, in the
uniform of their country, killed Russians and were killed
by Russians, yet the Congress of the United States never
declared war upon Russia.  Our war was with Germany,
but no German prisoners were ever taken in this lawless
conflict of North Russia, nor, among the bodies of the
enemy killed, was there ever found any evidence that
Germans fought in their ranks or sat in the councils of their
Command.  And in the conduct of the whole campaign
there was no visible sign of connection between the
Bolsheviks and the Central Powers.
</p>

<p>
The war was with the Bolsheviki, the existing Government
of Russia, and a few weeks after the arrival of American
troops in Archangel, Tchitcherine, Soviet Commissioner
for Foreign Affairs, handed a note to Mr. Christiansen,
Norwegian diplomatic attache, which was delivered
to President Wilson, in which the Bolsheviks offered to
conclude an armistice upon the removal of American troops
from Murmansk, Archangel and Siberia.
</p>

<p>
This note was ignored.  The Soviets had no recognition
as the government of Russia, and there was no "war" in
Archangel or Murmansk or Siberia.
</p>

<p>
No war, but in the province of Archangel, on six
scattered battlefronts, American soldiers, under British
command, were "standing to" behind snow trenches and
improvised barricades, while soldiers of the Soviet cause
crashed Pom Pom projectiles at them, and shook them with
high explosive and shrapnel, blasted them with machine
guns, and sniped at any reckless head that showed from
cover.
</p>

<p>
The objects of the Expedition, as defined in a pamphlet
of information given out by British General Headquarters,
in the early days of the campaign, were:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
1.  To form a military barrier inside which the Russians
could reorganize themselves to drive out the German
invader.
</p>

<p>
2.  To assist the Russians to reorganize their army by
instruction, supervision and example on more reasonable
principles than the old regime autocratic discipline.
</p>

<p>
3.  To reorganize the food supplies, making up the
deficiencies from Allied countries.  To obtain for export the
surplus supplies of goods, such as flax, timber, etc.  To
fill store ships bringing food, "thus maintaining the
economical shipping policy."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The Bolshevik government is entirely in the hands of
the Germans, who have backed this party against all others
in Russia owing to the simplicity of maintaining anarchy
in a totally disorganized country.  Therefore, we are
definitely opposed to the Bolshevik-cum-German party.  In
regard to other parties, we express no criticism and will
accept them as we find them, provided they are for Russia,
and therefore "out for the Boche."  Briefly, we do not
meddle in internal affairs.  It must be realized that we are
not invaders, but guests, and that we have not any intention
of attempting to occupy any Russian territory.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Later, this proclamation was issued to the troops by the
military authorities:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Proclamation: There seems to be among the troops a
very indistinct idea of what we are fighting for here in
North Russia.  This can be explained in a few words.  We
are up against Bolshevism, which means anarchy pure and
simple.  Look at Russia at the present moment.  The power
is in the hands of a few men, mostly Jews, who have
succeeded in bringing the country to such a state that order is
non-existent.  Bolshevism has grown upon the uneducated
masses to such an extent that Russia is disintegrated and
helpless, and therefore we have come to help her get rid
of the disease that is eating her up.  We are not here to
conquer Russia, but we want to help her and see her a
great power.  When order is restored here, we shall clear
out, but only when we have attained our object, and that
is the restoration of Russia.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At about the same time that this proclamation was spread
among British soldiers in Russia, the Inter-Allied Labor
Conference met in London and sent an expression "of
deepest sympathy to the labor and socialist organizations of
Russia, which having destroyed their own imperialism,
continue an unremitting struggle against German Imperialism."
</p>

<p>
Still later, there was broadcasted among the soldiers,
headed "Honour Forbids," an exposition of the campaign
by Lord Milner, British Secretary of State for War, who
defined its objects:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
1.  To save the Czecho-Slovaks.  Several thousand of
which under command of General Gaida were believed to
be strung along the Siberian railway from Pensa to
Vladivostok.
</p>

<p>
2.  To prevent the Germans from exploiting the resources
of Southeastern Russia.
</p>

<p>
3.  To prevent the northern ports of European Russia
from becoming bases for German submarines.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When these objects were accomplished, the British statesman
declared that to leave Russia to the unspeakable horrors
of the Bolshevik rule would be an abominable betrayal
of that country, and contrary to every British instinct
of honor and humanity.
</p>

<p>
During the winter months of 1919, when Senator Johnson
was demanding in the United States Senate the reasons
for the American war with Russia, Senator Swanson, of
Virginia, of the Foreign Relations Committee, and one of
the spokesmen of the administration replied that American
troops were needed to protect great stores of Allied
ammunition at Archangel, and to hold the port until terms
of peace were signed with Germany.  That Germany
wanted Archangel to establish a submarine base there, and
it would be cowardly to forsake Russia.
</p>

<p>
During the peace negotiations at a meeting of the Council
of Ten at Quai D'Orsay, on 21st January, 1919, President
Wilson, in discussing the Russian problem, stated that
by opposing Bolshevism with arms the Allies were serving
the cause of Bolshevism, making it possible for the
Bolsheviks to argue that imperialistic, capitalistic governments
were seeking to give the land back to the landlords and
favor the ends of the monarchists.  The allegation that
the Allies were against the people and wanted to control
their affairs provided the argument which enabled them
to raise armies.  If, on the other hand, the Allies could
swallow their pride and the natural repulsion which they
felt for the Bolsheviks, and see the representatives of all
organized groups in one place, the President thought it
would bring about a marked reaction against Bolshevism.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lloyd George, earlier in the discussion, said that
<i>the mere idea of crushing Bolshevism by a military force
was pure madness</i>.  Even admitting that it could be done,
who would occupy Russia?  If he proposed to send a thousand
British troops to Russia for that purpose, the armies
would mutiny.
</p>

<p>
It was agreed by the Council of Ten, then Four, that
President Wilson should draft a proclamation inviting all
organized parties in Russia to attend a meeting in order
to discuss with the representatives of the Allied and
Associated Great Powers the means of restoring order and
peace in Russia.  Participation should be conditional on
a cessation of hostilities.  This meeting was to take place
on Prinkipos Island in the Sea of Marmora.
</p>

<p>
The President issued the proclamation, but the French
were opposed to it and communicated with the Ukrainians
and the other anti-Soviet groups in Russia, to whom, as
well as to the Bolsheviks, the proposal was addressed,
telling them that if they refused to consider the proposal, the
French would support them and continue to support them,
and not allow the Allies, if they could prevent it, to make
peace with the Russian Soviet government.  The time set
for the gathering at Prinkipos was on 15th February, 1919,
but no party acted in a definite way and it never took place.
</p>

<p>
At the time of the Bolshevik revolution, the national
debt of Russia was 700,000,000,000 of rubles.  The
interest and sinking fund charge was 4,000,000,000 of rubles
annually.  There was a deficit in the annual budget of one
milliard.  Of this total debt, <i>15,500,000,000 of rubles were
owing to France</i>, and France felt the prospective loss far
more than any of the other creditor nations, for the French
government had encouraged the purchase of rubles by her
nationals, and these now nearly worthless securities were
held by the peasants from Artois to Gascony.

<p>
Like the Prinkipos proposal, nothing came of a Soviet
proposal for peace which was brought to the Paris Peace
Conference by an emissary dispatched by the American
commissioners to obtain from the Bolsheviks a statement of the
terms upon which they were ready to stop fighting.  This
was in February, after the desperate situation of the troops
near Archangel was brought to the attention of the
Conference by the Allied Military commanders.  These Soviet
peace terms were approved by Colonel House at Paris, who
referred them to the President, "but the President said he
had a one track mind and was occupied with Germany at
the time, and could not think about Russia, and that he
left the Russian matter all to Colonel House."
</p>

<p>
The sessions at Versailles adjourned without day [delay?].  If
we were at war with Russia in 1919, we are still at war
with her.  Peace was never made with Russia; and peace
never will be made in the hearts of those plain people in
the Vaga and Dvina villages, who saw their pitifully
meager possessions confiscated in the cause of "friendly
intervention," their lowly homes set ablaze and themselves
turned adrift to find shelter in the cheerless snows.
</p>

<p>
Friendly intervention?  All too vividly comes to mind
a picture during the Allied occupation of Archangel
Province while the statesmen at Paris pondered and deliberated
in a futile attempt to find dignified escapement from this
shameful illegitimate little war.  Military necessity
demanded that another village far up the Dvina be destroyed.
As the soldiers, with no keen appetite for the heartless job,
cast the peasants out of the homes where they had lived
their uncouth, but not unhappy lives, the torch was set to
their houses, and the first snow floated down from a dark,
foreboding sky, dread announcer of the cruel Arctic winter.
Within these crude, log walls, now flaming fire, had they
lived, these gentle folk, as their fathers had lived before
them, simple, unsophisticated lives, felicitously unmindful
of petty vanities and corroding ambitions.  Who can say
theirs was not the course of profoundest wisdom?  For had
they not known in these humble homes those candid pleasures,
the only genuine ones, those elemental joys, springing
like hope and the unreasoning urge of life from the
heart of humanity, oblivious of all artificial environment?
Here in these mean abodes had they tasted the ecstasy of
love, known the full poignancy of sorrow, wept in natural
grief and laughed loud with boisterous, unrestrained, rustic
laughter.  In a corner hung the little ikon, where the lamp
burned on holidays, and they worshipped their God with
a devotion so genuine, so deep and reverent, that only a
fool could scoff.
</p>

<p>
Outside now, some of the women ran about, aimlessly,
like stampeded sheep; others sat upon hand fashioned
crates, wherein they had hastily flung their most cherished
treasures, and abandoned themselves to a paroxysm of weeping
despair; while the children shrieked stridently, victims
of all the visionary horrors that only childhood can conjure.
</p>

<p>
Most of the men looked on in spellbound silence, with
a dumb, wounded look in their eyes.  Poor moujiks!  They
did not understand, but they made no complaint.  <i>Nitchevoo</i>,
fate had decreed that they should suffer this burden.
</p>

<p>
Why had we come and why did we remain, invading
Russia and destroying Russian homes?  The American
consul at Archangel sent us the Thanksgiving Day message of
our President, rejoicing in the Armistice, and the end of
the carnage of war.  But the consul announced that we
would remain steadfast to our task until the end.  The
end!  What was the end?
</p>

<p>
The British General Finlayson of Dvina Force said:
"There will be no faltering in our purpose to remove the
stain of Bolshevism from Russia and civilization."  Was
this, then, our purpose through the dismal night of winter
time, when we burned Russian homes and shot Russian
people?  And was this still our purpose when we quit in
June with Bolshevism strengthened by our coming, and
more than ever before the government of Russia?
</p>

<p>
The only stain was the stain of dishonor we left in our
retreating path.  But a deep, red, burning stain of shame
is on the foreheads of those men who sit on cushioned seats
in the high places, chart armed alliances in obscure
international commitments, and, with careless gesture of their
cigar, send other men to some remote forsaken quarter of
earth, where there is misery and suffering, and hope dies,
and the heart withers in cold, black days.
</p>

<p>
Now it was of small concern to Ivan whether the Allies
or the Bolsheviks won this strange war of North Russia.
What he heard was some vagary of "friendly intervention";
of bringing peace and order to his distracted country.
What he saw was his village a torn battle ground of
two contending armies, while the one that forced itself
upon him, requisitioned his shaggy pony, took whatever it
pleased to take, and burned the roof over his head.
</p>

<p>
He asked so little of life, this gentle moujik, with his
boots and his shabby tunic, and his mild, bearded face, only
to be left alone.  In peace to follow his quiet ways, an
unhurrying, unworrying disciple of the philosophy of <i>nitchevoo</i>.

THE PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="intro">
"I consider it my duty to inform you in plain language
that unless considerable reinforcements are sent
before the end of October, the military situation both
at Archangel and the Murman Peninsula will, in my
opinion, become very serious."
</p>

<p class="intro">
ADMIRAL KEMP, in command of British warships at Murmansk, to
the Admiralty, 26th August, 1918.

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3b">

</p>

<p class="t3">
THE PLAN OF CAMPAIGN
</p>

<p>
The Province of Archangel stretches from the Norwegian
frontier across the Arctic Ocean east of the
Ural Mountains of Siberia.  It includes the Kola Peninsula,
which lies well north of the Arctic Circle, and the further-most
point south is below sixty-two degrees latitude.  The
total area is six times that of the average American state.
</p>

<p>
It is a poverty distressed and cheerless, destitute region,
which, during the reign of the Romanoffs, like Siberia, was
often a place of exile and asylum for political dissidents.
War accentuated the poverty of the province, and the only
remanent sign of former industry is at the port of Archangel,
where large timber mills, owned mostly by British
capital, line both sides of the harbor.
</p>

<p>
The port was founded by Ivan the Terrible during the
Sixteenth Century, and ever since then has been a British
trading post.  At Onega, Kem and Kamdalaksh on the
White Sea, there is, or was, before the war, some small
traffic in timber products, furs and flax.  But this
commerce is of small consequence.  Prenatally, Archangel was
destined for pauperism, for it lies in the far north, where
life is poor and hard struggling, and there is little soft
sunshine to woo riches from the earth.  Nor are treasures
concealed beneath its sear and barren surface.  The curse
of sterility taints the air, and it was never written in the
Divine Plan that man should dwell in this fortuneless,
forsaken region.  He was banished there, or driven by the
pitiless pursuit of his own misdeeds.  For nearly half of
the year, the White Sea is an impenetrable ice barrier, and
then communication with the world beyond can be had
only through the Murman railway to the far north port
of Murmansk.
</p>

<p>
In the city, the East comes abruptly face to face with
the West.  The exotic colors of the great domed cathedral
were brought from ancient Byzantium, when the Greek
church was made the faith of his country by Vladamir;
and bearded, sad-faced priests, with their black robes, glide
through the streets like nether spirits, and the mysticism
of the ancient, mystic East.
</p>

<p>
This is the native atmosphere of Archangel, and it will
not be in a generation that the city will, without consciousness,
take on the soft adornments and the practical utilities
of Occidental civilization.  The glaring electric lights, the
incongruous, modern buildings and the noisy tramway that
clangs down the street&mdash;these do not belong to Archangel.
They are a profane encroachment on her ageless, dreaming
tranquillity and eternal repose; her enigmatical,
perhaps profound philosophy of <i>nitchevoo</i>.
</p>

<p>
Fundamentally, Archangel is a primitive center of primitive
beings.  Instinctively, it is a dirty hole.  Hopelessly,
it is a filthy place, where noxious stenches greet the nose
and modern sanitation is unknown.
</p>

<p>
In the days of peace, there were perhaps three hundred
fifty thousand people in the province, and sixty thousand
of them dwelt in Archangel.  The only other cities of
importance are Pinega, with three thousand persons, some
one hundred miles to the east, and Shenkurst, two hundred
miles south on the Vaga River, where there were four
thousand.  But as a whole, the inhabitants are moujiks,
dwelling in little villages of two or three hundred log huts, that
in structure and design bear close resemblance to the cabins
of our frontier civilization.
</p>

<p>
About these villages, the peasants have cleared the
forest for a few hundred yards, and in the brief, hot months
of the midnight sun, they raise meager crops of wheat and
flax and potatoes.  When winter comes, they are continually
indoors, gathered about great ovens of fireplaces, and
long through the dismal, cold, black days they sit and
dream, or merely sit.  They are unsophisticated folk,
incredibly ignorant, but gentle, quiet mannered, sweet natured
souls, despite a harsh, uncouth life; and very responsive
to kind treatment.
</p>

<p>
Cholera visits them with recurrent, devastating plagues,
and takes fearful toll, for they live in the midst of nauseating
squalor, with total disregard to sanitation, and drink
from surface wells, that in the sudden spring are reservoirs
of sewage and all manner of obscene refuse.
</p>

<p>
All along the rivers and roads of the interior, at intervals
of five to ten miles, are strung these moujik villages.
</p>

<p>
There is, among these people, no agriculture as we
practice it in our country, with a set of prosperous looking
farm buildings for the cultivation of two hundred and
five hundred broad, fertile, American acres.  In Russia, I
never saw more than five hundred cleared acres for an entire
village.
</p>

<p>
Yet, from these small, unfecund patches, the peasants,
somehow, wrung the means of sustaining life, and those
who toiled in the fields divided the scanty harvest with
the aged and the weak, and the children who were fatherless:
so that there was no mendicancy among the moujiks,
and no affluence either.
</p>

<p>
There are two railways in Archangel Province, the
Murman road, which begins at Murmansk on the Arctic Ocean,
extends south to Kem through Petrozavodsk, and forms
a juncture fifty miles east of Petrograd with the
Trans-Siberian, nine hundred miles from the point of beginning;
and the Archangel-Vologda railway, which reaches from
Archangel four hundred miles south to Vologda, where the
Siberian road comes in from Viatka on the east and leads
to Petrograd.  Both railways have the standard five feet
gauge single track.  During the winter of 1919, the
Murman road, with a theoretical capacity of thirty-five hundred
tons, had an actual hauling capacity of only five hundred
tons a day, and its rail connections were in very poor
condition and badly in need of repair.  The Vologda road had
a single track, but with sidings every five miles.  Both
roads had obsolete rolling stock, rickety, tumbled down cars
and wood-burning locomotives of a type used in our country
fifty years ago.
</p>

<p>
During the war with Russia, the Allies, with a medley
force of friendly Russians, British, Canadians, French, a
battalion of Serbians and a battalion of Italians, held the
Murman railway as far south as sixty miles beyond Soroka,
which is a little south of Archangel and two hundred miles
to the east.
</p>

<p>
There were no Americans on this Murman railway front,
except two companies of railway transportation troops,
which reached Russia in April and were the last to leave in
July, 1919.
</p>

<br />
Patrols with webfoot snowshoes went forth on the snow
</p>

<p>
Beyond the Murman and the Vologda railways, the only
other highway to the interior is the Dvina, a dirty colored,
broad spreading river, which from its beginning, as the
Witchega, at the base of the Timan Range in Vologda
province, follows a swift flowing course one thousand miles
northwest to the sea at Archangel.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, when its banks are low and it sprawls out in
play, its waters glide noiselessly with a look of gentleness
and peace, and the Dvina puts one in mind of our Mississippi;
but usually its cold depths are freighted with grave
mystery and melancholy foreboding, and then it is the
spirit of Russia, hurrying by forested shores and high,
desolate bluffs, where a mill, near a huddle of soiled log
houses, flaps its clumsy, wooden wings, and a white church,
with fantastic minaret, rears aloof, chaste and austere, in the
midst of squalor.
</p>

<p>
During the period of navigable water, in the days of
peace, the Dvina was plied by steamers and barges and
watercraft of every description, but the freeze commences
in early November, and then, until the last days of May,
its waters have become a bed of thick ice.
</p>

<p>
Then, except by the Vologda railway, the only method
of transportation between Archangel and the interior is by
sledges, drawn over the snow by little shaggy ponies that
can perform miracles of labor and seem impervious to the
terrible, cold winds.  These ponies are the embodiment of
the moujik temperament, docile and mild mannered, very
patient and long suffering, and never resentful of the most
severe chastisement.
</p>

<p>
The whole province is a plain of low, gentle slopes,
covered with small fir trees and several varieties of dwarfed
pine.  A long, dormant season and the severity of winter
preclude any luxuriant, ligneous growth.  Even the
underbrush is sparse and thinly scattered, and commercially,
about the only value of the Archangel forests is for the
manufacture of pulp.  The bottom of this spindly pine
woods is covered with a tundra.  Sometimes, there are
patches of waist deep water, and in other places, a morass
that seems bottomless.
</p>

<p>
Such is the character of all the North Russian forests.
The natives tell stories of men, unfamiliar with the country,
who have lost their way and floundered in these treacherous
marshes until they passed from sight without a sign
of their passage.
</p>

<p>
During the rains of fall, and when summer bursts upon
winter, in June, is the season of <i>rasputitsa</i>.  The wagon
roads then are sloughs of deep mire, and little travel is
attempted.  The first snow falls in November and
gradually mounts, until in January it has a uniform height of
three feet, except in the open places where there are great
drifts much higher.  No thaw comes until late February,
and so moving for any distance on foot is impossible
without skis or snowshoes.  Cold follows the snow, gradually
increasing in intensity until there are January days of
forty-five and fifty degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
</p>

<p>
When the wind is high and the air filled with great,
white blasts, this cold of Russia presses on the diaphragm
like a ponderous weight and breathing becomes a gasping
effort.  In the depth of winter, the sun is banished, and
during the latter part of December, only a few hours of
pale, anemic glimmering separates the black Arctic night;
a shadowy gloaming, like shortlived, desert twilight.
</p>

<p>
Splendid, fighting men were made weak cowards by
the cumulative depression of the unbroken, Russian night
and its crushing influence on the spirit; for the severest
battles of the campaign were fought during the cold, black
months of winter time.
</p>

<p>
Preparations for opening hostilities in the war with
Russia were made in April, 1918.  The Allied Supreme War
Council had been alert to the presence of German troops
in Finland and their fanciful menace to the Murman
railway; and in the quiet harbor of Murmansk, British and
French battleships had been idling purposelessly since early
spring.  In April, one hundred fifty Royal Marines landed
from the British ships and were followed in a few weeks
by four hundred more, also a landing party of French
sailors.  On 10th June, the United States warship,
<i>Olympia</i>, appeared at Murmansk, and one hundred American
bluejackets disembarked.  These Allied forces penetrated
down the Murman railway to Klandalaksh, some two
hundred fifty miles south, and, in addition to holding
Murmansk, seized the port of Petchenga on the coast of
Finland.
</p>

<p>
Then the scene of intervention shifted southward, and
on the 1st August, General Poole, with a party of five
hundred fifty French, British and a few American marines,
escorted by a British cruiser, a French cruiser and a trawler
fleet, attacked Archangel, which, after a bombardment, was
surrendered next day by the weak Bolshevik rear guard.
</p>

<p>
The main body of the enemy had carried with them
far up the river to Kotlas and down the railway to Vologda,
rations, rifles, guns and ammunitions, American manufactured.
Likewise, they had seized and carried off nearly
all available means of transportation; and when the Allied
troops examined the vast storehouses in the harbor and at
Bakaritza, they found that the Bolsheviks deliberately,
systematically and with great thoroughness had stripped the
shelves of every conceivable thing of value.  If the object
of the Archangel Expedition was to safeguard the vast
munitions and stores there, it had failed signally and at
the outset.
</p>

<p>
Still the enemy had fled, for, by some occult form of
necromancy the Bolsheviki had now become "the enemy,"
and it is a major premise of the military that a fleeing
enemy must always be followed up.  Small heed that little
was known of the strength or disposition of the retiring
army.  They had fled.  Two forces were immediately
dispatched in pursuit, up the river and down the railway; and,
to augment the strength of the invaders, new troops were
sent from Europe.
</p>

<p>
The 339th American Infantry arrived at Archangel on
4th September, 1918.  It was composed of Wisconsin and
Michigan men, mostly the latter; men from our farms and
from our cities, who had been drafted for war against
Germany.
</p>

<p>
Like most of our civilian soldiers, they had no exuberant
ecstasy for the grim business ahead, but still possessed a
remarkable appreciation of the war and its deep significant
issues.  And they had a quiet courage that was good to
see, and a quiet resolution shorn of sentimental heroics to
give their lives for their country if the sacrifice was
necessary.  Not one of them was deeply agitated by the emotion
of "Making the world safe for Democracy," which is the
desiccated war cry of the academician and never could reach
the heart depths of any people; but they did feel in some
vague, yet definite way, that a soulless military system,
which had trampled brutal, iron-clad boots through the
gentle fields of Belgium, might some day carry its hateful
spate to the Michigan village or green-hilled Wisconsin
farm, where an old lady with spectacles sat behind the
window of a white cottage, and near lilac bushes growing
fragrant in the lane a wholesome faced girl waited.
</p>

<p>
These soldiers of Russia were of the same type as our
men who fought in France&mdash;no better and no worse; another
way of saying that they were the best soldiers in the
world.  They were all drawn from the Eighty-fifth
Division of the National Army, and came from all the races
and shades and grades and trades of our many colored
American society.
</p>

<p>
Many of them had had only a few weeks of crowded
military training, and were still civilians in physique and
bearing.  Most important of all, they were civilian in
mental constitution.
</p>

<p>
With the 339th Infantry, came the 337th Field Hospital
Company, the 337th Ambulance Company, and the 310th
Engineers, a splendid, upstanding, competent battalion, that
in the approaching ordeal upheld the best in our American
traditions, showed extraordinary power of adaptitude,
extraordinary resourcefulness, no matter the difficulties,
were ever cheerful and undaunted, and altogether splendid.
</p>

<p>
Roughly, the entire force of the Americans aggregated
forty-five hundred men.  It was augmented about a month
later by five hundred replacements, snatched here and there
from the infantry companies of the Eighty-fifth Division
in France.
</p>

<p>
That September day the Americans landed at Archangel,
and the fagged engines of the troop ships <i>Somali</i>, <i>Tydeus</i>,
and <i>Nagoya</i> came to rest, those who looked from the decks
breathed in the oppressive air a haunting presentiment of
approaching evil.
</p>

<p>
Halfway from camp at Stoney Castle, England, five
hundred of the little company had been stricken with the
dreaded Spanish influenza.  Eight days out at sea, all
medical supplies were exhausted, and conditions became so
congested in the ships' quarters that the sick, running high
fever, were compelled to lie in the hold or on deck exposed
to the chill winds.
</p>

<p>
At Archangel, there was little improvement.  Soldiers
were placed in old barracks, there they lay on pine boards.
They had insufficient bedding, and for warmth had to keep
on their clothing and boots.  In this way many died and
many more were enfeebled for many months, but "stuck
it" with their companions and went to the front.
</p>

<p>
Had the Fates placed a curse on the Expedition from
the beginning?
</p>

<p>
There was an air of inscrutable haunting sorrow in the
lowering skies, glinted limpid with a sinister, bronzed light
from a sun that flamed to crimson death among the dark
trees over the bay.
</p>

<p>
Across the harbor projected the tiny red roofs of the
city, the venerable cathedral, ghostly with great white
dome, grotesque fantastic spires and minarets, garish in the
fading light with startling pigments of green and gold.
A mournful stillness brooded over a scene weird and alien
to the men from far off Michigan and Wisconsin, who had a
feeling that they had left behind forever the stage of tedious
factory days and prosy farm life, and moved to another
sphere, shrouded in mystery, filled with unparalleled, dread
adventure.
</p>

<p>
Besides the American regiment, there was a British brigade
of infantry nearly the same strength as the Americans,
in the main composed of Companies of Royal Scots, most
of them catalogued by the War Office as Category B2 men;
unqualified for the arduous, exhausting tasks of an active
field campaign, but fit enough to safeguard stores in
Archangel, "light garrison duty."
</p>

<p>
Many wore the bronze wound stripe, and many had two
and even three of these honorary decorations.  These
war-tired soldiers, wearied to the point of cruel exhaustion,
had given freely and without stint of their body on the
Western battlefields for King and Country; but the great
Empire was backed to the wall and fighting for her life
in an insatiable conflict, she exacted the last draining dregs
of their gasping strength.  That these "crocked" Category
B men performed prodigies of fortitude and miracles of
endurance, and acted deeds of stirring, spiritual courage in
this war of the Far North is a permanent tribute to a
manhood that England breeds, and imperishable glory to
British arms.
</p>

<p>
The French sent eight hundred and forty-nine men and
twenty-two officers, a battalion of the 21st Colonial
Infantry, two machine gun sections and two sections of
seventy-five millimetre artillery.
</p>

<p>
On the railway front, there was an armored train, with
one eighteen pounder, one seventy-seven millimetre and
one hundred fifty-five millimetre Russian naval howitzer.
Then came early in the campaign the Sixteenth Brigade
Canadian Field Artillery consisting of the 67th and 68th
Batteries, each with six eighteen pounders and tough
gunners seasoned and scarred by four years of barrages and
bombardments in France, rather keen for the adventure of
North Russia while the fighting was on, and thoroughly
"fed up" when there was a lull in the excitement.
</p>

<p>
These Canadians, in peace, had probably been kindly
disposed farm folk, gathering the rich bronzed harvests of
Saskatchewan fields.
</p>

<p>
But four years of war had wrought a transfiguration of
many things and no longer did life have its exalted value
of peace times.  No, life was a very cheap affair, but,
cheap as it was, its taking often made exhilarating sport.
At the end of a battle these quiet Saskatchewan swains
passed among the enemy dead like ghoulish things, stripping
bodies of everything valuable, and adorning themselves
with enemy boots and picturesque high fur hats, with
abounding glee, like school boys on a hilarious holiday.
</p>

<p>
Yet there was nothing debased or vicious about these
Canadians.  They were undeliberate, unpremeditated
murderers, who had learned well the nice lessons of war and
looked upon killing as the climax of a day's adventure, a
welcomed break in the tedium of the dull military routine.
Generous hearted, hardy, whole-souled murderers; I wonder
how they have returned to the prosy days of peace, where
courage counts for little, and men are judged not by the
searching rules of war, but by the superficial standards of
secure being; and living is soft and slow, an affair of
rounding chores, with few stirring moments to illumine the dull
routine of most of us.
</p>

<p>
At the outset, the Canadians and a few inaccurate
Russians were our only artillery.  Two months after the
commencement of the campaign, two Four Point Five howitzers,
with British personnel, joined the Allied Forces, and there
were several airplanes, considered obsolete for use in France,
but good enough for the Arctic sideshow.
</p>

<p>
The air pilots were daring and courageous men, but,
besides being hopelessly handicapped by defective machines,
they complained that the forests of North Russia made
definite discernment of the ground a very difficult thing.
The facts are that they dropped several bombs on our own
lines, and twice with tragic disaster.  There was never
any apparent reason to believe that the airplanes caused
the enemy even passing uneasiness, but we were always
agitated as their menacing drone approached, always
grateful when they trailed off to distant skies.
</p>

<p>
The complete combat command of the Commanding General
of the Allied North Russian Expedition at the outset
of the campaign was then:
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  One regiment of American Infantry,<br />
  One brigade of British Infantry,<br />
  One battalion of French Infantry,<br />
  Two sections of French Seventy-Fives,<br />
  Two sections of French machine gunners,<br />
  One brigade (487 men) Canadian Field Artillery,<br />
  One armored train,<br />
  One 155 millimetre and<br />
  One 77 millimetre Russian howitzers.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There were a few groups of Russian Infantry with the
Allied troops, but at the outset these did not number over
three hundred men.  In all, there were approximately nine
thousand five hundred combat troops.
</p>

<p>
With this force, the Allied Commander proposed to
engage in an aggressive campaign, to drive the enemy before
him and follow up along the two main ways of ingress
to the interior.  Troops were at once dispatched down the
railway to penetrate as far as the city of Vologda four
hundred miles to the south, and other troops were sent by
tug and barge up the Dvina River, with Kotlas, three
hundred miles southeast, as their immediate objective.  From
Kotlas, there is a branch railway leading two hundred
fifty miles further south to the Trans-Siberian at Viatka.
</p>

<p>
When their missions were accomplished, the Railway
Force at Vologda would be nearly due east of the Dvina
Force at Viatka, and distanced four hundred miles across
the Trans-Siberian railway.
</p>

<p>
Beyond this stage, the Allied plan was somewhat hazy.
It contemplated rather vagrantly a fusion with the Czecho-slovaks
along the Siberian railway, after penetration south
to this trunk line.
</p>

<p>
A volunteer brigade of these adventurous soldiers who
had been Austro-Hungarian prisoners, but whose
whole-souled sympathy was with the Allies, organized in their
native Bohemia and Moravia, and joined General Broussiloff
in the spring of 1917 to take part in the victory of
Zborow near Lemberg.  Moving to the railway between
Kiev and Poltava in the Ukraine, the brigade recruited
more Czech prisoners in Russia until it had grown to the
strength of two divisions.
</p>

<p>
After the peace of Brest-Litovsk, this army corps pushed
forward to the middle Volga in the direction of Kazan
and Samara intending to reach Vladivostok and sail from
there to join the Allied Command in France.
</p>

<p>
The Soviet authorities promised them safe convoy over
the Siberian railway, but instead, treacherously attacked
at Irkutsk in Siberia on 26th May, 1918, and the Czechs
then divided into two groups, one determined to fight
through to Vladivostok, the other under General Gaida
bent upon joining the Allied invasion from Archangel.
</p>

<p>
Although this last aim was not realized (and would
have profited little if it had been) the Czechs performed
a service of inestimable consequence to the Allies by acting
in conjunction with the Anti-Bolshevik Siberian troops,
and with the small Allied Eastern Expedition of Great
Britain, Japan and the United States, in holding the
Trans-Siberian open from Omsk to the coast, so preventing the
transportation of many thousands of German prisoners back
to Germany.  When the Archangel fiasco was brought to
a close they withdrew to their own country in October,
1919.  And, reviewing the whole unproductive Russian
effort in retrospect, the Czechs came closest towards a
realization of the mythical "Eastern Front," for, while they
could not engage in aggressive action, they did much by
negative methods, denying Germany great numbers of
returning soldiers that might have been welded into a
considerable effective combat force for the Western theatres
of war had they been free to enter their country from the
Eastern frontier.
</p>

<p>
The hopelessness of a junction between the Archangel
Expedition and the Czechs became certain at the beginning
of the northern campaign, and General Poole was advised
by the British War Intelligence that Gaida had been driven
back in Samara five hundred miles from Viatka and could
advance no farther before the commencement of winter.
</p>

<p>
Still the optimistic Allied Staff clung tenaciously to the
belief that all the Anti-Bolshevik Russians could be joined,
the Czechs, the Cossacks that General Denekin had
organized between the northern Caucasus and the sea of Azov,
and a group of loyal officers of the Imperial Army with
General Korniloff along the Don.  It was within the Allied
range of possibilities that all these scattered groups might
join the British, French and Americans on the Siberian
railway, and after the Staff was thoroughly committed to
an offensive campaign, there arose the hope of cooperation
from the friendly Russian forces in Siberia.  On 18th
September, 1918, at Ufa, there was a meeting of
representatives from the Governments of Archangel, Eastern and
Western Siberia, Samara and Vologda, which purported to
form a Central government of all Russia, and to restore
the Constituent Assembly.
</p>

<p>
On 25th October, this group moved to Omsk, created
Admiral Kolchak Military Dictator 18th November, and
proposed to raise a strong armed force to purge Russia of
Bolshevism for all time.
</p>

<p>
The Allied governments were quick to recognize this
Omsk group as the de facto government of Russia.
</p>

<p>
It was hoped that the armies of Admiral Kolchak could
get in communication with the Allied Forces working down
from the Arctic.
</p>

<p>
This, then, was the culmination of the first stage of
the campaign: There was to be a junction of the Americans,
French and British from the North; Czecho-Slovaks,
and the armies of Kolchak from the East; Korniloff and
Denekin from the South.  Tens of thousands of patriotic
Russians were to join the colors of these armies,
converging somewhere on the Trans-Siberian, between Perm and
Vologda; from Vologda the way would be unopposed to
Petrograd, and from Petrograd the Allied-Russian legions
would move on and reconstruct the Eastern front,
threatening Germany from the northeast!
</p>

<p>
There was nothing lacking in the imagination of the
plans of the Allied High Command, whatever else might
be said about them.
</p>

<p>
The Northern Expedition with great combative esprit
set forth vigorously to traverse Archangel the whole length
of the province by river and railway with two "Columns"
which were even to penetrate well into Vologda Province.
Starting from Archangel, the Dvina river and the
Vologda railway rapidly diverged east and west, so that at
the first point of contact with the enemy, the two main
bodies of the invader were seventy-five miles apart; and
if their object, i.e., to reach the Trans-Siberian had been
realized, they would have been four hundred miles apart
on that railway.
</p>

<p>
There was no wire communication between these Allied
Railway and River Forces, and of course liaison over the
lateral terrain impassable swamp in fall, and a field of deep
floundering snow in winter, was impossible.
</p>

<p>
As the invasion developed, the two columns of necessity
operated as independent expeditions, with no attempt at
establishing connection.
</p>

<p>
To reach their joint objective, the Siberian railway, it
was necessary for the River Force to travel one hundred
fifty more miles than the Railway Force.  Moreover ice
was expected during the first part of November, and if
Kotlas was to be taken by the river, it was necessary to
advance the three hundred miles in scarcely six weeks from
the time of leaving Archangel.
</p>

<p>
When forced to assume the defensive in the late fall,
the Dvina Column was nearly fifty miles in advance of
the Railway front position, and the Vaga Column, an
intervening force that was found necessary to prevent an enemy
rearward movement on the river, was fifty miles in advance
of the Dvina Column.
</p>

<p>
Lacking any effective communication between bodies of
troops, the military incursion was expected to penetrate
an unknown alien country, where there proved to be far
more hostile sentiment than friendly cooperation.
</p>

<p>
There was no reconnaissance of the country; no physical
inventory of the lay of the land; no reliable military maps;
no knowledge of the paths through the swamp-bottomed
forests; no information of the roads.  Many an early
attack was lost because the frontal advance failed to get
support of the flanking party that became hopelessly mired
in the deep marshes and never got to the fight.
</p>

<p>
The climatic conditions were a permanent obstacle to an
offensive campaign.  When the snow came and the weather
grew intensely cold, even if we had possessed the
necessary men, it would have been madness to think of an
offensive in the open.  Then it was possible only to dig in and
hold on.
</p>

<p>
Yet despite the intense sub-zero weather there was little
trouble with the field guns which during the most severe
days recoiled and ran up without any jar.  Moreover, there
was not so much suffering from the cold as might be
supposed.  The Command thought that the Siberian railway
would be reached before the serious winter set in,
nevertheless the expedition was excellently well equipped for
the Arctic weather.  Soldiers were issued long fur lined
coats, fur hats and had an abundance of other good warm
clothing and plenty of blankets.  The men from Northern
Wisconsin and the Michigan peninsula did not mind greatly
the severe winter days.  There was some frost bite from
unavoidable exposure, and much terrible privation in the
defensive actions; but on the whole the Allied soldiers
withstood the cold as well as the Bolsheviks.
</p>

<p>
The strength of the enemy was an unknown factor.  So
were his positions and his dispositions.  There were no
supports, no reserves.  The base of the invading army in
Russia was Archangel, a fortnight's journey from the
far-most front and nearly three thousand miles from the main
base in England; Archangel, in complete isolation during
the six months of winter.
</p>

<p>
There were no reinforcements at Archangel ready to
relieve the jaded soldiers so far away, who had to
continue doing double duty and fighting against greatly
superior numbers with no promise of relief.  More important
than the objective fact was the thought of being thus
forsaken that froze the soldier's heart and numbed his brain
and never left him through the long blackness of the days.
It was the same feeling of palsied hopelessness that comes
over the city bred man who finds himself lost in the
wilderness.  The soldier felt he was abandoned by his country,
that he was forgotten and left to his fate in the grisly plain
of pitiless, white Russia.
</p>

<p>
Then there was no diversion, no break in the gloomy,
monotonous, despairing hours; no relaxation from the
ceaseless vigilance in the guard against surprise attack; no
respite from the constant threat of annihilation.  The drear,
sorrow freighted clouds menaced death.  There was the
message of Death across the bleak, endless, desolate snows.
Death haunted the shrouded, hopeless days, and in the
shadow of the encircling forests, Death waited.  It was
the most severe strain to which human intelligence could
be subjected.
</p>

<p>
Many lessons were learned in the war, and none so
clearly as the one that human endurance cannot be taxed
beyond capacity without a resultant of diminishing military
returns.
</p>

<p>
In France it soon became a corollary, universally accepted
by all the Staffs, that men could not be subjected
to the strain of continuing horrors and uninterrupted drain
of physical resources without a pronounced lowering of
fighting morale.  It was calculated to a nicety how long a
soldier could endure mental shocks and suffer hardships
until his nervous system snapped and his distraught brain
could tolerate no more.
</p>

<p>
These things were all weighed in the precise scales at
the laboratories of the war establishment and provision
was made for human limitations, so that there grew up
three units in every combat army.  One of them attacking,
or standing the brunt of enemy assault; another in
the supporting trenches, to be used in great emergency, but
most important of all to become accustomed to the terrifying
effect of the big guns; and a third that was far back,
where there was a warm bath and clean clothes, peace in
the sky and the soft grass still grew green, where men
drank deep their little day of life, and found oblivion from
the animal filth and unspeakable griefs, the awful hideousness
of modern warfare.  It came to be recognized that
reliefs of troops on the combat first lines were as
necessary as ammunition and ration supply.
</p>

<p>
But there were few and in some cases there were no
reliefs for fighting men in North Russia, because there was
no support unit from which to draw reliefs, and no reserve
unit to call forth from the rear for those at the front.
</p>

<p>
The Russian Expedition, if its object was to drive the
Bolsheviks clear of Archangel Province and south of the
Siberian railway, required for execution of this object an
army corps with entire component of artillery, and in this
war with Russia, Great Britain and France and the United
States failed because of:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
1.  Inadequate forces in the Allied Command.
</p>

<p>
This was not only true with respect to numbers, but
also with respect to armament and equipment.
</p>

<p>
We had no artillery support.  We were outgunned from
the outset and continued to have marked artillery
inferiority throughout the campaign.  Time after time, the
infantry, after gallant success, was shelled out of position,
while our own guns were silent because outranged.  The
effect on the morale was most disastrous.
</p>

<p>
On the River Front, there were three Allied gunboats
which cooperated effectively during the first days, but
during the latter part of October, when the fight began, these
withdrew to Archangel in fear of becoming caught by the
ice which formed at the mouth of the Dvina, and then
moved slowly upstream against the strong current.
</p>

<p>
It took a week for this ice barrier to travel one hundred
miles against the course of the river, so that the enemy had
unhindered opportunity to bring up his artillery mounted
on watercraft, which he did, and blasted our positions for
two weeks after the Allied boats had gone back to winter
quarters.
</p>

<p>
Nothing was more discouraging than this hopeless inferiority
in long range guns.  Assaulting troops, no matter
how spirited and courageous, cannot hold their advance in
the teeth of a bombardment that scatters emplacements
like chaff before the wind and shocks men into a state of
insensibility.  The stunning effect of massive, high
explosives is more important than the casualties caused by
direct hits.  Nerves are palsied, then fly from control under
unremitting blasting salvos.  Fortifications are blown to
atoms, and debris thrown up like vomit in a deafening
belch, a bolt of hottest hell; while the earth quivers like
a frightened living thing.  And if modern warfare has
demonstrated one thing more than any other, it is the prime
necessity of artillery support, especially during the attack.
After three years' experience, the French and British Staffs
laid down the rule that for an offensive to be made with
any hope of success, there should be a field gun covering
every ten yards of the objective and a heavy gun every
thirty yards.
</p>

<p>
The British provided fifty-six heavy guns and howitzers
per division, and of these twenty-nine were six inch and
over.
</p>

<p>
The French had fifty-eight guns in each division,
forty-six of which were six inch and over.
</p>

<p>
These divisions were made up of two brigades of two
regiments each, a total of fourteen thousand four hundred
men.
</p>

<p>
The Americans in France had two regiments of 75 mm. guns
and one regiment of 155 mm. guns for every combat
division on the first lines.  At Archangel there was not a
six inch gun in the Allied Command until the late days of
spring when the Americans were evacuated.  There was
only the Russian naval howitzer on the armored train.
And the only other heavy guns were two Four Point Five
howitzers of the 41st Royal Field Artillery.
</p>

<p>
Besides this fatal lack of artillery, the Allied Command
was miserably supplied with other armament.  In the early
days we had only a few machine guns and these were
Vickers, with water cooled system, that became frozen and
would not function in the severe cold.  We had few Trench
Mortars and no rifle grenades or hand grenades.  But most
disheartening of all were the Russian rifles issued to the
infantry.  They were manufactured in our country by the
million for use of the Imperial Army; long, awkward pieces,
with flimsy, bolt mechanism, that frequently jammed.
</p>

<p>
These weapons had never been targeted by the Americans,
and their sighting systems were calculated in Russian
paces instead of yards.  They had a low velocity and were
thoroughly unsatisfactory.  The unreliability of the rifle,
prime arm of the infantry, was an important factor in the
lowering of Allied morale.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
2.  Underestimation of the enemy forces and his military
capacity.
</p>

<p>
The Allied military authorities looked with contempt
upon the Bolshevik movement, and viewed it as simply a
sporadic outburst of outlawry that would pass like all
disorganized brigandry.
</p>

<p>
The facts were that this war was waged against the
government of the Russian people.  The de facto authority
was in the hands of Lenine and Trotsky at Moscow.  The
Omsk group was distinctly an expression of the minority
and the ancient Imperialists who were obstinately
impervious to the new Russia flaming in revolution against age
long abuses and tyrannies of the old order that could never
be returned.  The Omsk group never quickened any popular
response.  It lacked essential authority.  The spectacular
success of Admiral Kolchak before Perm was not followed
through, and his government waned while the Bolsheviks
grew in strength every day.
</p>

<p>
The Soviet army was despised as an undisciplined rabble,
without equipment or officers or commissary organization.
But the Bolshevik soldier was as well equipped as we were,
and incomparably superior in the larger arms.  He was
often better rationed, and sometimes led better.
</p>

<p>
During the winter of 1919, Trotsky, an outstanding
military genius, raised from the Kerensky rabble an army
of one million men, which William C. Bullit of our State
Department saw in March of that year at Moscow, and
described as thoroughly soldierly looking, thoroughly
trained, well rationed, and well provided for.
</p>

<p>
From Moscow to Vologda, is less than three hundred
miles by the railway which continues straight to Archangel.
Why the Soviets did not concentrate a division on
the railway, move straight to Archangel and leave the
scattered Allied battalions bottled up in the interior is one of
the many mysteries of the Expedition.
</p>

<p>
In February, Omberovitch, the Commander of the Bolshevik
Northern army, announced that he would hurl the
foreign invader into the White Sea and concentrated over
seven thousand men in an attack on Shenkurst, the Allied
position on the Vaga river.  This force was ten times the
strength of the defenders, who were driven back verst by
verst over the deep snows to Kitsa, sixty miles down the
river, and the Allied Staff prepared rearward positions in
anticipation of withdrawal about Archangel and a last stand
there a few weeks later.  The enemy struck again with
overpowering numbers at Bolshie Ozerki near the Railway.
</p>

<p>
But he never consolidated his success.  For some
inscrutable reason withheld the knockout blow, and, before
he could reorganize for another advance, spring came with
the <i>nasta</i> or thaw, and he had to pull back his artillery
or abandon it in the bog.  He also brought great forces
in November to the assault of the River position, and
attacked the Railway in spring with large numbers and with
great vigor; but despite his vast superiority in guns, and
his great advantage in strength, he could not, or <i>did not</i>,
break through to complete victory and destroy our
scattered, weakened battalions.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps one reason the Bolsheviks did not massacre the
puny Allied forces was because the nature of conditions in
North Russia did not permit the concentration of great
masses for the attack.  The little villages, even with
greatest crowding, could only house a few hundred men.
Except at Shenkurst, where the most ambitious thrust was
made, there was shelter for only a few thousand soldiers,
and shelter was as essential as rations in this war of the
Arctic.
</p>

<p>
Another reason may have been that Lenine had sagacity
and imagination enough to know that a complete massacre
would have fired the people of Great Britain and France
and America with burning indignation and a demand for
revenge which their governments could not deny.  Better
to whittle away the little Allied company by methods of
attrition.  There was no prize in Archangel.  The Bolsheviks
had stripped that city of everything valuable long
before the Allies came to Russia.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
3.  Ignorance of the military commitment.
</p>

<p>
The difficulties of conducting an offensive campaign in
Archangel province were at the outset not understood or
realized by Allied Headquarters.
</p>

<p>
Military men have asked me why the Commanding General
did not, if determined upon an aggressive warfare,
concentrate his small numbers for an advance on the Vologda
railway, leaving a cordon of well fortified outposts
about Archangel, sufficiently distant to protect the city from
artillery bombardment.
</p>

<p>
By such a method, he could have held his little force
well in hand, would have safeguarded Archangel and fulfilled
the real mission of the expedition (if guarding Archangel
was the mission), with small cost and few casualties.
</p>

<p>
The answer to this is that British Headquarters was
determined upon an offensive program, and committed
itself to a punitive chase of the Bolsheviks, regardless of
the nature of such an undertaking, heedless of where it led,
blind to consequences.
</p>

<p>
As the Allies pushed into this unknown country, it
became apparent that between the two Columns advancing
by the Dvina river and by the railway, there stretched a
great, unsounded territory, entirely unreconnoitered, and
through which by many routes, the enemy could threaten
the tenuous unguarded lines of communication with Archangel.
</p>

<p>
It was necessary to put out flanking parties and to keep
an eye to the rear.  At Kodish, fifty miles east from the
Railway and also on the Vaga river, which forms a junction
with the Dvina one hundred and fifty miles from Archangel,
it was imperative to organize invasions auxiliary
to the two main bodies.  Likewise, from east and west,
threats were made upon the security of the city of
Archangel, and it became necessary to establish detached
outposts in Pinega Valley, one hundred miles on the left flank,
and Onega Valley, about the same distance on the right
flank.
</p>

<p>
Also, isolated garrisons were installed in villages in the
rear&mdash;at Seletskoe on the Emtsa, and at Emetskoe, where
this small tributary flowed into the Dvina; at Morjagorskaya,
midway between Emetskoe and Bereznik, and Bereznik
itself, fifty miles farther south on the Dvina, where
there was an important subsidiary base; at Shred Mekrenga,
where there was an important road, and at other villages
in the interior, little groups of soldiers were stationed, and
often lieutenants short from civil life found themselves
"Officers Commanding," faced with the problems and
responsibilities of Field Officers.
</p>

<p>
By December, the Allied fighting forward stations in
Archangel Province were extended in the form of a huge
horseshoe, and a line drawn from flank to flank and
covering the forward position would have reached out five
hundred miles.
</p>

<p>
There were six principal American battlefronts: Pinega,
Onega, the Vologda Railway, Kodish, the Vaga River, and
the Dvina.  Each of these in the war of North Russia
formed a distinct episode quite apart from the others.  The
soldiers on the Dvina were entirely in ignorance of the
fate of their companions on the Railway.  At other points
in the interior many did not even know that there were
American outposts at Onega and Pinega; and so the
history of the expedition must of necessity be a series of
disjointed apparently fragmentary accounts of each separated
battleground&mdash;in truth a description of six little
campaigns with only one point of contact, that all Americans
went out from Archangel in the fall of 1918 and in spring
the following year those who still lived <i>quit</i> (under orders),
from the same quarter.
</p>

<p>
Twice during the expedition an attempt at liaison was
made between the Railway and its theoretical supporting
flanks, Onega and Kodish, and Shred Mekrenga, but both
occasions demonstrated that cooperation was impossible.
The other forces on the rivers and at Pinega were as
unrelated as if they had been situate at opposite poles.  Each
operated an independent, unconnected war, learning about
the other fronts only through wild and distorted rumors of
disasters, and hearing from far off Archangel only
intermittently.
</p>

<p>
Thus the Allied North Russian Expedition melted away
in the snows, and the first flushed extravagant egoistic
ambition of conquest and aggression was followed by a sober
appraisal of the grave peril of annihilation.
</p>

<p>
When the policy of aggression had been carried so far
that it was too late to change, General W. E. Ironside
assumed command.  He was a great tower of a man, the
embodiment of soldierly force and resolution.  He directly
announced that all ideas of a further offensive were
abandoned and that all fronts from thenceforward would be
content to hold their ground.
</p>

<p>
General Ironside has been criticised adversely for not
withdrawing his scattered troops to Archangel to await the
breaking up of ice in spring, when ships could enter the
harbor and the fiasco be terminated by evacuation of
Russia.  But this criticism is unfair and unwarranted.
</p>

<p>
It was too late for such a change of policy.  It would
have been disheartening to the defenders of these distant
fronts after the costly toll of the defense to have abandoned
their hard fought posts.  It would have been a giving of
ground that would have heartened the enemy and thrilled
him with new life; for the Bolsheviks were never exalted
by victory, they paid dearly for every inch they gained,
and our men, except when overwhelmed on the Vaga, never
retreated from a position which they had fortified and
determined to hold.
</p>

<p>
There were no prepared defenses on the outskirts of
Archangel, and the defensive garrisons between the front lines
and the city were far separated and inadequately fortified
to withstand an extensive assault.  Transportation of the
retreat over the deep snowed roads would have been beset
with terrible and afflicting hardship.  There were long,
cruel snow spaces between the villages that lay along the
backward way and very scanty opportunities for shelter.
</p>

<p>
The task given to General Ironside, to retrieve the North
Russian Expedition, was not within the range of human
accomplishment.  He did the best he could with the means
at hand, which was to hold grimly on until those who
directed from far off Europe, and who knew nothing of the
gravity of the situation, or did not appear concerned if
they did know, came to some sort of decision.
</p>

<p>
General Ironside conducted his defensive campaign with
inspiring leadership, with unfailing heartsome courage; and
he won the sympathy of all by his rare tact and understanding,
and the affection of all by his consideration for
the men, his efforts to stay the casualty lists.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
4.  The want of a definite moral purpose.
</p>

<p>
Since the days of Thermopylae, the effect of spiritual
stimulus upon the fighting qualities of fighting men has
been known the world over.  The military people make a
concrete thing of this, and attempt to diagram it, analyze
and classify it in their treatises, where they call it morale.
</p>

<p>
As well might one try to reach out and touch any other
manifestation of the soul.  This exaltation that comes over
soldiers and makes them glad to die, firm in their faith
of the sacred character of their cause is above all finite
measurements.
</p>

<p>
It is the purging light of the spirit that floods men's
souls and raises them aloft from the restraining imprisonment
of physical being to the heights of the gods.  On no
other grounds can one explain the superhuman valor of
the lone Cheshire Company of the "Contemptibles," which,
in the retreat from Mons, held up until dusk a German
column of three battalions.
</p>

<p>
The French had morale at Verdun when they said, "They
shall not pass," and fulfilled the eloquence of their words
by the offering of their bodies.
</p>

<p>
The Americans had morale at Chateau-Thierry.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-070"></a>
<br />
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-070.jpg" alt="SITUATION MAP--Showing principal battlefronts" />
<br />
SITUATION MAP&mdash;Showing principal battlefronts
</p>

<p>
The British at Mons, the French at Verdun, and the
Americans at Chateau-Thierry, fought as they did because
they knew, or thought they knew, the cause of the fight.
</p>

<p>
But in Russia, the soldier was never told why he fought.
At first, this was not thought necessary.  Then the High
Command, remembering the importance of morale, and
recognizing the need of some sort of explanation, if only for
the purpose of regularity when men were asked to risk their
lives, issued proclamations that puzzled and confused the
soldier more than if a course of silence had been followed.
</p>

<p>
While all this time to the Americans came newspapers
from home with accounts of speeches by politicians and
demagogues who fired Bolshevik bullets from the rear and
extolled the Soviet cause, hailing it as an heroic progression
in human effort.
</p>

<p>
There is another axiom in the military books, that soldiers
fight best on their native soil and in defense of their homes;
but here was a company taken fresh from civil occupations,
with a civilian mental outlook, set adrift in an alien
country, six thousand miles from home, engaged in a desperate,
sanguinary war, and asked to undergo privation and
hardship, to face untold perils for unmentionable reasons.
</p>

<p>
Still, though the expedition was committed to no definite
moral purpose, there was a morale in North Russia.  A
morale that arose from comradeship in a fated enterprise,
a morale of seeing the bitter game through, taking risks
and meeting perils that must be borne by others if even
one shirked his share.  A noble, selfless devotion, playing
the man's part in a lottery with Death, where Life was
the stake.  The upholding of some elemental metaphysical
creed that could be definitely felt but never understood, a
code of challenged manhood that had come down through
many generations of warring ancestors&mdash;this was the
morale of North Russia; it brought forth the best and the
purest in our manhood, and recorded deeds that no survivor
can recall without quickening heart beats, and a profound
belief from what he saw, that the spirit is supreme and
triumphs over the body of man.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
5.  The Russian people did not rally to the Allied Cause.
</p>

<p>
If the fight was for Russia, the Russian people were cold
and apathetic, the worst of ingrates.  Many Russians had
the impression that we had come to restore another
Romanoff to the throne.
</p>

<p>
The statement of the American government, with respect
to the reasons for military intervention, put the case
as if the Allies were engaged in a high-minded, selfless
service for Russia, but the great mass of moujiks were indifferent
to our immolation, and showed undisguised relief when
we finally and ignominiously quitted their country.
</p>

<p>
During early August, a government of the north had
been installed at Archangel by a coalition of Cadets,
Minimalists, members of the People's Party and Social
Democrats, with a bourgeois cabinet and with an old man, Nicolai
Tschaikovsky, as President of the province.  But it was a
fact known to all that the Allies determined the policies
of this government, that it was in fact merely a guise for
an Allied Protectorate.
</p>

<p>
This government of the North it was that had invited
military intervention; but had a plebiscite been called, the
people would have registered their voice in unmistakable
terms and volubly Russian "Let us alone.  <i>Nitchevoo</i>."
</p>

<p>
Thus the campaign was another effort of England to
impose her will upon an inferior people, and bring them
for their own good to a higher order of things, disregardful
of their volition in the premises.  It was an echo of South
Africa and Egypt, Mesopotamia and India, inspired by that
lofty faith in Britain and the immortal commission of the
Empire to rule an afflicted world and bring the blessings
of sustained order, where only trouble and chaos prevailed
before.
</p>

<p>
In Archangel, an ambitious attempt was made to recruit
Russians under the high sounding name of The Slavo British
Allied Legion, and after most energetic efforts, about two
thousand starved moujiks, seeking something to eat, joined
the ranks; indifferent mercenaries never to be trusted in
the tight positions.  They were given the khaki of the
Tommy, but there all resemblance to the British men of
war ended.  Their pay was in worthless rubles.  They were
given an inferior ration, were treated patronizingly.
Between them and the Allied soldiers there never was that
generous comradeship that leaps the restraints of divergent
language and manners when men fight shoulder to shoulder
for life and some things that are more dear than life itself.
It was a case of alien spirit above all else.  British officers
never could understand why the Russian officers, with the
acute, sensitive nature of the Slav, were quick to feel and
keen to resent, seemingly studied slights and snubs and
discourtesies.  Russians of culture and refinement never
could penetrate the unfailing reticence and frigid
unsympathetic exterior in which gentlemen of England have been
schooled for generations beyond memory, habitually to
conceal the emotions.
</p>

<p>
When the utter failure of the volunteer system became
certain, thousands of Russians were coerced into the army
by a draft system; but these failed too, because their hearts
were cold to Russian patriotic British appeals; because
there was no great moral issue, no moving cause for the
fight.
</p>

<p>
The war with Russia was in fact a typical British show,
conducted by that conquering people who have spread the
dominions of the mother country to every shore of the far
seas.  A war that was waged with the invincible will, that
noble effacement of physical comfort; that indomitable
purpose and masterful determination; that courage and
careless naivete, and contempt of danger and risk; that
splendid sportsmanship, that love of fair play; and all the
sublime self sufficiency, all the muddling, blundering and
fuddling, the lack of understanding, the brutal arrogance
and cold conceit, and apparent heartlessness and want of
sympathy that are forever British.
</p>

<p>
Naturally, the British assumed direction, just as in
France when the first Americans came Clemenceau and
the Earl Haig demanded that they be fed piece meal to
the French and British front divisions; but the soldier,
Pershing, sensing the important moral value of having his
men go to battle under the American flag and directed by
American officers, waited and would not yield to the
strongest pressure.  And it was an American army that brought
us to glory at Saint Mihiel and Chateau-Thierry and the
Argonne forest; an all-American army led by American
divisional commanders.
</p>

<p>
There are racial differences, racial prejudices, racial
disparities, and racial asperities that cannot be gainsaid even
under the influence of impersonal military discipline, and
experience has shown that soldiers yield a more ready
obedience to leaders who speak their own language; understand
the philosophy of their daily lives, and at no other time
did General Pershing so demonstrate his greatness, his
complete understanding of the perplexities in Allied military
organization as by his courageous insistence upon the
solidarity of the American army on the battlefields of France.
</p>

<p>
But in Russia the American regiment was at once merged
with the British Command, and from first action until the
end of the campaign, British Headquarters directed and
controlled the dispositions and conduct of the Americans.
</p>

<p>
At Archangel there is a modern, spacious white building,
and here from steam-heated headquarters Colonel George
W. Stewart commanded the United States 339th Infantry,
here were quartered his staff officers, the unemployed
"brains" of our Northern American army.  He never saw
any part of his regiment in action.  For a long time I
believe he had not even a vague notion regarding the location
of his British dissipated troops.
</p>

<p>
Embassies of France and Serbia, Poland, and Italy were
in Archangel, and the American Ambassador, David R. Francis,
came from Vologda there early in August, and
stayed until sickness compelled him to leave for England
during the winter.  And there was an American Military
Attache who developed into a Military Mission with
Colonel James A. Ruggles as chief, and a staff of officers
to assist him.  Also there was an American Consulate, with
an American Consul General, Dewitt C. Poole, who at times
appeared to take over a supervision of the American share
in this strange, strange war with Russia.
</p>

<p>
And over across the harbor at Bakaritza, a well-fed
Supply Company watched over mountains of rations and
supplies that had been brought all the way from far off
America; supplies and little good things and comforts that
would have heartened and brought new life and hope to
the lonely, abandoned men on the far fighting lines in the
snow.  These supplies never reached the front, but the
Supply Company, with American business shrewdness and
American aptitude for trading, acquired great bundles of
rubles, and at the market place converted these into stable
sterling, and came out of Russia in the springtime with
pleasant memories of a tourist winter; likewise a small
fortune securely hid in their olive drab breeches.  But there
were others who ate their hearts away, fretting and
chafing, in Archangel, whose petitions to go to the front to
play the man's game were denied by those in command.
</p>

<p>
British G.H.Q. brought six hundred surplus officers and
forty thousand cases of good Scotch whiskey.  Some of the
officers had come frankly in search of a "cushy job" in a
zone they thought safely removed from poison gases and
bombardments and all the hideous muck of the trenches.
Others, much to their disgust, had been sent to the polar
regions because some one in Headquarters had thought they
possessed some peculiar qualification to command or "get
on" with imaginary Russian regiments that were to spring
to the Allied Standard.
</p>

<p>
So it was that Archangel became a city of many colors,
as gallant, uniformed gentlemen strode down the Troitsky
Prospect, whipping the air with their walking sticks, and
looking very stern and commanding, as they answered many
salutes, in a bored, absent-minded way.
</p>

<p>
There were officers of the Imperial Army, weighed down
with glittering, ponderous honor medals, and dark Cossacks
with high gray hats, and gaudy tunics, and murderous noisy
sabers.  Handsome gentlemen of war from England, from
Serbia, Italy, Finland, France, and Bohemia, and many
other countries, all arrayed in brilliant plumage, and
shining boots, and bright spurs, and every other kind of "eye
wash."  And, of course, there were large numbers of
batmen to shine the boots and burnish the spurs, and keep all
in fine order, and other batmen to look after the appointments
of the officers' club, and serve the whiskey and soda.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoons there were teas, and receptions and
matinees, and dances in the evening, when the band played
and every one was flushed with pleasure and excitement.
Such flirtations with the pretty <i>barishnas</i>, such whispered
gossip and intrigue and scandal in light-hearted Archangel!
</p>

<p>
At Kodish, at Onega on the Vaga, and at Toulgas, far
off across the haunting snows, sick men and broken men,
men faint from lack of nutrition, and men sickened in soul,
were doing sentry through the numbing, cold nights,
because there were none to take their places in the blockhouses,
and no supports to come to their relief, no reserves
to hearten them and give them courage.
</p>

<p>
The blockhouses so far away, where men were maimed
and crippled and shell shocked, and the black hopelessness
that crept into men's hearts, and strangled men's hearts,
and overcame their soldier spirit&mdash;in the blockhouses&mdash;far,
so far off from gala Archangel.

THE RAILWAY
</p>

<p>
When the troops of Poole's first expedition divided
at Archangel, and one group was sent up the Dvina;
another which was a part of the French Colonial battalion
was told off for pursuit of the Bolsheviks down the
Archangel-Vologda railway.
</p>

<p>
Hot and eager for first blood, the French hurried forward
until the Kayama River was reached, where the enemy
made an unexpected stand.  There was a sharp engagement,
the Bolsheviks were severely punished, and one hundred
and fifty prisoners fell to the Allies.
</p>

<p>
But a little further, at Obozerskaya, some hundred miles
south of Archangel, the despised fugitives turned again and
displayed an amazing disposition for combat, entirely at
variance with the cowed spirit of the feeble rear guard
that had surrendered Archangel.
</p>

<p>
They came back in force and greatly outnumbered the
Allies, and there was in the defiant attitude of the Red
troops reason to believe that the Soviet chieftains had taken
stock of the military situation, had verified the
preposterous intelligence that the Three Great Powers&mdash;Great
Britain, France, and the United States&mdash;were definitely
bent upon war and seriously intended to invade the great
domain of Russia with scarcely two infantry combat
regiments!
</p>

<p>
Reports came of fast gathering Bolshevik armies at all
fronts massing for attack, prepared to take offensive action
on a grand scale, and, hardly had the campaign entered
upon its initial phase, when the utter inadequacy of General
Poole's numbers made egregiously evident the impossibility
of the proposed investment by River and Railway.
</p>

<p>
The two "Columns" were in simple truth little patrol
parties, and, as they drove further into the interior, the
ridiculous audaciousness of their ambition to sweep the
enemy from Archangel Province, and south even beyond
Vologda Province, seemed almost beyond the purview of
sane contemplation.
</p>

<p>
Highways for flank envelopment, and byways for
encirclement, commenced to appear with discouraging
frequency the further the advance developed in this unknown,
speculative, shadowy hinterland, and all of these avenues
for surprise attack had to be watched and safeguarded.
One of these was the Vaga river, which meets the Dvina
near the Allied subsidiary base at Bereznik; where an
auxiliary, flanking expedition was detailed from the River
Column, for this tributary is capable of floating substantial
craft that could transport artillery and many infantry
from the Bolshevik stronghold at Velsk in Vologda Province,
and north of Velsk is Shenkurst, the second city of
Archangel, with a political significance that could not be
neglected by this politico-military excursion into the interior
of Russia.
</p>

<p>
If left unguarded, the Vaga would be an open invitation
for the Bolsheviks to capture this supply depot, Bereznik,
and gain the rear of the Allied Dvina forces.
</p>

<p>
Many other routes for enemy movement developed as
the invasion paused, undecided whether to retire for
consolidation, or to try to plug up these many openings for
enemy movement, and as the Command stood hesitant, still
other approaches by flank and rear were revealed.
</p>

<p>
It was (or became) known that the headquarters of the
Sixth Bolshevik Army was stationed at the city of
Vologda, from which its commander could send troops north
along the railway, and assail the Allied frontal position,
or detrain, and move his men on roads and trails that took
off along this route and led to the Allies' flanks and rear.
</p>

<p>
One of these roads follows down the Onega valley north
to the port of Onega.
</p>

<p>
At Chekuevo, it is nearly opposite the Allied advanced
railway position, Obozerskaya, and these two villages are
joined, fifty miles cross-country, by a good roadway that
in winter is capable of supporting artillery carriage.  Some
fifteen miles west from Obozerskaya, on the same road,
Bolshie Ozerki, several groups of moujik huts, lies in
sprawling confusion.
</p>

<p>
Late in the winter, a pitiful little outpost of French and
friendly Russians, an immolation to this campaign of
invincible folly, was destroyed at Bolshie Ozerki in a massed
enemy effort that sought to annihilate the whole Expedition.
</p>

<p>
A few platoons of American infantry were stationed at
Onega to shield Archangel from the west, and to watch
this Onega, Chekuevo, Bolshie Ozerki, Obozerskaya
communication line, which linked up Archangel with
Murmansk, and, during the frozen months, was the only outlet
to the world beyond the Arctic Sea.
</p>

<p>
The main Bolshevik stronghold north of Vologda was
at Plesetskaya, some fifty miles south of the furthermost
position of the Allies on the railway, from which an
Imperial Government highway reached out through Archangel
Province northeast as far as Emetskoe, on the Dvina,
passing through the villages Kochmas, Avda, Kodish, and
Seletskoe, near the Emtsa river.  At Kochmas, another road
branched east to Tarasovo, thence north through Gora and
Shred Mekrenga.
</p>

<p>
From Shred Mekrenga and Seletskoe, the enemy could
have access to the lower Dvina, head off all supply convoys
for the Dvina and Vaga columns; and hold the Allies
trapped far up stream.  Therefore, two more auxiliary
expeditions were organized, and, instead of two invading
"Columns," the Allied forces, woefully insufficient at the
outset, were operating in seven columns, separated detachments,
advance parties, outguards, outposts, flanking forces,
and all along the Dvina, from Kholmogora to Bereznik,
a stretch of one hundred miles, were still other detached
soldier groups watching the treacherous way from
Archangel, a Cossack Post in one village, a squad in another,
in still another a platoon, all without communication and
completely undefended in case of real attack.
</p>

<p>
There was unlimited chance for rear movements along
that tenuous, unprotected, communication line.  General
Ironside would have massacred the Bolsheviks had positions
been reversed.  The Germans would have annihilated the
Allied North Russian Expedition with half the numbers
that the Bolsheviks had.
</p>

<p>
During the winter, several circling movements were
essayed, but never on a scale of comprehensive organization;
at Morjagorskaya, in February, and at Shred Mekrenga,
the enemy came closest to success, but at both places was
stopped by the gallant British, and when spring came his
chances vanished, the bogging quagmire precluded any
further offensive.  But while the Bolsheviks did not
destroy the Expedition, they soon reduced the invasion to
a series of desperate, detached, outguard actions, and the
River and Railway Columns that were to have entered
Kotlas and Vologda with the coming of the first snow, were
flung far and broad over vast Archangel, as the effort "to
stage a real show with two men and an orange" wilted
with the first snow, a dismal, ghastly "washout."
</p>

<p>
Even when the Americans reached Archangel in September,
the campaign had already assumed a defensive character.
Indeed, so serious was the outlook that they were
rushed from the troop-ships, shunted off to Russian box
cars, and consigned with expeditious haste to the Railway
Front.
</p>

<p>
Nothing of this was known to these new zealous soldiers
off from a brief military training encampment to the very
heart of war's purple, glamourous adventure.  And it is
doubtful whether they could have realized the significance
of the military situation, even had it been communicated
to them.  In a few crowded weeks, so many stirring events
had thronged their heretofore placid lives that these recruits
from Michigan and Wisconsin were buried beneath a
bewildering wilderness of amazing impressions through which
confused, alien scenes and persons and places trooped in
phantom and fantastic multicolored parade, until their
minds were stunned beyond the power of further reception.
</p>

<p>
During the long voyage, a few still civilian in mind,
had recovered sufficient equipoise to inquire about the
connection between a war in Russia against Germany, but
the inquiry was so unproductive, so futile, and there were
so many eccentric twists and turns to this stupendous world
madness that in most part they soon fell into that fatalistic
philosophy of all soldiers; most of them were content to
place their unbounded trust in those who sat in the high
places and whose omniscience guided from afar.  It was
far more quieting, vastly more satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
Once, during that swaying night journey, from Archangel
to the battle line, the decrepit Russian locomotive
gasped convulsively and stood still by an old station of
huge logs, and, under the lurid light of a flaming torch,
was revealed a trainload of prisoners, passing north from
the scene of hostilities somewhere below.  They made an
unheroic spectacle, with their shrinking countenances and
unsoldierly, nondescript uniforms, so that some American
wag, in a spirit of bantering patronage, called them "Bolo
wild men," a name that clung to the enemy throughout
all the days of the campaign.
</p>

<p>
But the shabby prisoners, first living sign of real battle,
sent a thrill up and down the spines of these young men,
who were so ardent for war and knew so little about it.
They sniffed the air of conflict, yearned to give the "Bolos"
a taste of their quality, and promised themselves that the
folks back home would have nothing to be ashamed of when
they came under fire.
</p>

<p>
The next morning the depressing aspect of the dirty,
unkempt group of huts where the soldiers detrained almost
passed unnoticed alongside the captivating spectacle that
stood on the track nearby, a ferocious war monster, with
massive plates of steel like dragon's scales, huge funneled
naval guns, and locomotive set in rear of trucks which were
piled with sand bag barricades where Lewis automatics
poked out murderously, manned by a hodge-podge
Polish-Russian crew, who were themselves manned by competent
appearing, war-weathered British N.C.O's.
</p>

<p>
A narrow threadlike swath trailed through the stunted
starveling forest to the lowering gloom of dull, laden skies,
and the hearts of the fresh, battle eager soldiers swelled
big as they gazed far down the gleaming rails to the murky
mystery of No Man's Land.
</p>

<p>
There was in the air a peculiar, dispiriting quality, a
brooding, pensive, Russian note that cannot be made known
except to those who have felt it.  Stillness, heavy almost
to the point of suffocation, the shroud of skies that hover
mourning on the trees, and the shadow of unlifted gloom
that reaches out from the forest and bears down upon the
spirit with deep intangible melancholy.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the quiet was broken by the distant boom of
a heavy gun.  Then an ominous whine circled from the
ground, approached snarling stridently high in air, and fell
with a crumbling roar seemingly very near the new soldiers,
who, on command, scampered to cover from their erect
column of twos on the naked embankment.
</p>

<p>
A cordon of strongpoints had been constructed around
the village, Obozerskaya, and these the Americans took
over, tensed for the impending battle.
</p>

<p>
But inexplicable days passed, and the Bolo did not come.
There was not even a feint of attack, and the Allied
Command, with short memory for the hazardous nature of its
extended position, the apprehension it had felt only a little
while before, began to chafe for action, became impatient;
again the military fetish of an "offensive campaign" grew,
waxed strong, became assertive once more, and again the
ambitious vision arose to take Vologda before the snow.
</p>

<p>
"All patrols must be aggressive," directed a secret order
of the officer in command, "and it must be impressed on all
ranks that we are fighting an offensive war and not a
defensive one."
</p>

<p>
So American officers, directed by ranking British officers,
moved their companies forward to the "offensive war," and
four miles beyond Obozerskaya, where a post on the
railway bore the Russian characters "Verst Four Sixty Six,"
they closed with the Bolos and drove them beyond the
bridge at Verst Four Sixty Four.
</p>

<p>
In the counter-attack that soon followed, one platoon of
the Americans, separated in the swamps of the woods, was
nearly enveloped.  It fought until all ammunition was
exhausted, and then the officer, Lieutenant Gordon Reese, had
no thought of submission.  After the last cartridge was
gone, the bayonets still remained, and after the bayonet,
came doubled fists.  At word of command, the platoon fixed
bayonets, went forward with a yelling charge, broke down
the Bolsheviks by their sheer courage and impetuosity, and
the endangered men were able to join the main body of
their comrades, repulsing the attack.
</p>

<p>
Before Verst Four Fifty Eight, Allied aggressive operations
were resumed when one of the French companies came
back from Archangel to assist in moving against the strong
enemy works.  There was a bridge at Verst Four Fifty Eight.
If this was destroyed, it would take a long time to rebuild
and seriously impede the "offensive war" down the Railway.
It was, therefore, intended to drive the Bolos back so
violently that they would have no chance to detonate the
important bridge.
</p>

<p>
The plan of attack was for a three-fold movement:
front, right flank and rear.  The French company,
supported by the artillery of the armored train, an American
machine gun section, and twenty-one Americans, with three
Stokes mortars (who were not entirely sure of the use of
these weapons) were to hit out at front.  The rest of the
Americans, two infantry companies, were to form as many
detachments and rush the enemy from his east flank and
rear at his furthermost trench back at Verst Four Fifty
Five.
</p>

<p>
The frontal assault would wait on these circling movements;
a bivouac in the woods, and at dawn, timed together,
the three parties would move to the three-quartered battle.
The distance through the woods to the enemy rear was
"estimated at from six to eight miles."
</p>

<p>
But, in execution, the plan failed dismally, like many an
operation that carries through flawlessly around the military
council table, for "estimates" are of little use in the service
of battle conduct, where time is reckoned in seconds, and
victory measured in minutely fluctuating scales.
</p>

<p>
The contemplated operation was to approach the enemy
flank through one of those lofty, forest aisles, which were
cut with masterful, precise woodcraft by the engineers of
Peter the Great, entirely transverse Archangel Province.
Regularly, narrow lanes intersect these forest aisles, and it
seemed to the officer planning this attack a simple thing to
follow one of these lanes, and take the course of a north and
south aisle until a point was reached opposite the enemy
position.  He did not know that those forest paths were
deep with clinging, slimy morass, and bog that gave no
footing, that frequently the main cuttings opened before
shallow lakes of open water.  There was no reliable map
to show these things, and no native would admit that he
knew the way.
</p>

<p>
So the attackers went forth over unknown ground, and
soon were stumbling in a blackness so dense that one file
could not see even the outline of the preceding file.  The
sinking bog made the march distressingly arduous, yet for
hours the company kept resolutely on, when, without
warning, the forest parted and the sodden way terminated in a
wide sheet of open water.
</p>

<p>
It is impossible in the night blindness to know position
or location, or how far the exhausting, laborious pace has
made.  Startlingly near comes the coughing exhaust of a
locomotive, doubtless the armored train standing by the
Bolshevik defenses on the tracks.
</p>

<p>
In their jaded and spent condition, the men are ill fit
to engage in battle, yet there is nothing to do but have a
go at it, so plowing through waist deep swamp and awful,
oozing quagmire, they lurch on.  Struggling forward, still
forward, they are caught and tripped, and sprawl splashing
in the cold water and the bog, but they get up and drag
on until all are breathing with heavy, sobbing gasps; and
under the strain of terrible exertion, all are weakened, some
so done in, that they lie in the water like wounded animals
on their haunches, and have to be helped forward by others
of more physical strength or greater will.
</p>

<p>
In this agonizing way, perhaps a few hundred wallowing
yards are made, but it is clear that the company cannot go
on, and there is no hope of end to the miserable, sinking
marsh; so the officers hold council, and decide, not without
great reluctance, to abandon their mission, and the word
is passed on to the scattered troops to follow back over the
way they came.
</p>

<p>
In the darkness and the trackless morass, this is not
easy, as through the endless black night the lost company
struggles flounderingly and with little hope, until the heart
of all is cold with despair; but more blighting than the
knowledge of being lost in the wilderness of Russian
swamps, and the depression of abject, physical exhaustion,
is the mordant disappointment of failing the expectant
French in the coming fight.
</p>

<p>
At dawn, two soldiers, who, in days of peace, had been
timber cruisers in the pine woods of the Michigan Peninsula,
led their comrades to ground firm enough for footing, and
half dead from fatigue, brought them back to the railway,
but too late, for hours before the tumult and shots of
battle had reverberated from far advanced ground on the
railway tracks; for, at the appointed hour, hoping that the
cooperating actions would still develop, the French went in
to the attack, supported by the American trench mortars
and machine guns, and smashed the enemy from his foremost
lines.  Directly he rallied and returned in force to
the counter-attack in which many French were killed, the
trench mortar section was decimated and lost most of the
guns, the machine gunners put out of action, and the
whole little force was shoved back over much of the freshly
won ground to the bridge at Verst Four Fifty Eight, where
the Americans stood with braced backs and would not yield.
</p>

<p>
For two days, the Bolo armored train showered them
with shrapnel, and upcasted tons of high explosives that
tore glaring, wide wounds in the railway track, till
theoretically they were hammered into submission, but when the
Bolshevik infantry, in the gray hours of dawn and dusk,
approached to take the crucial position, they were always
driven to cover by a heroic defense that never failed.  So
the bridge was held under difficulties that would have
shaken ordinary troops and caused them to fall back, but
not in Russia, for that was the way of this queer little war.
Priceless lives would be lost, much blood run, and stirring
exploits of courage and noble sacrifices be performed, to
safeguard a little bridge like Verst Four Fifty Eight, or a
dirty village that objectively meant nothing.  Yet what
sacrilege to have breathed this to the soldiers who bled for
them; for to those who risked their lives and yielded up
their lives, rather than desert some little bridge or moujik
village, these signified the shibboleth of North Russia.
</p>

<p>
For inordinate stress was placed upon these inconsequential,
hard contended spots; they became graphic in the
imagination, cardinal precepts in some strange soldier creed,
altars upon which friends had given all as proof of a
comradeship triumphant over self and self desire.  Indeed,
with the fresh recollection of courageous comrades now
dead, their abiding faith in him, and the thought of those
far back at home, whose eyes watched from afar with
undimmed loyalty, did he not stamp himself as a craven if
he failed, a mongrel thing unfaithful to his breeding?
</p>

<p>
Thus has it always been.  The race has carried on by
dimly understood, irrational traditions that move men to
the profoundest depths and challenge elemental impulses
that have descended in transmuted ancestral determinism,
we know not how or why.  And if we are to endure, it must
be by these same primal emotions, that cause men the
world over to scorn soft ease and security for the sake of
a vague, inexplicable ideal; inchoate conceptions of service;
passionate, stirring impulses lacking definition, which
are born with life itself, reach down to the bottommost
depth of nature and transcend all feeble efforts of analysis
and artificial ratiocination.
</p>

<p>
So it came that the momentous bridge at Verst Four
Fifty Eight stood fast, and the Bolshevik attack beat
against an unyielding rock until it spent itself by its own
fury.  Then the position was consolidated, Allied headquarters
moved nearly three miles down the railbed, and the
dead, in order that there might be no interruption of the
renewed offensive, were laid away in white Obozerskaya
churchyard, beneath rough crosses of wood, such harsh
emblems of life's surcease, and so fitting in this inflexible,
cold, repellent north world.
</p>

<p>
After a fortnight of more scheming and preparation, the
forest was carefully reconnoitered, a path that could be
traversed was found through the swamps, in a three cornered
attack, the Allied position advanced to Verst Four Fifty
Five; and pressing on, the Americans and French went
forward to still further battle.  But now occurred an event
more baneful to the Expedition than all the enemy attacks.
The month was only October, but in some mysterious way,
the French had already received word of the pending
Armistice, and entirely unmoved by the disaster that might
befall their abandoned comrades, the whole French
company quit the front and went back to Obozerskaya in an
ugly mood.
</p>

<p>
"The war is over in France," they argued, "why should
we be fighting here in Russia when France has declared no
war on Russia or the Bolsheviki?"
</p>

<p>
Ninety of the mutineers were placed under arrest, and
returned to Archangel for confinement.
</p>

<p>
It is not known whether or not the Bolsheviks were
directly apprised of the mutiny, but hardly had the French
retired, when the enemy artillery laid down a shaking
barrage, and when night came, the lone group of Americans
were standing off a great horde of Bolo infantry that only
waited for dawn to continue an overwhelming assault.
</p>

<p>
Clearings occurred at intervals of several miles all along
the Vologda railway.  Usually they were in the shape of
large squares, a half mile or more across, with log stations,
several woodchoppers' houses in the center, and near them
piles of corded pine to feed the wood burning locomotives.
The next day when the supports came up they nearly
blundered on a large Bolshevik force massed for a surprise
attack in one of these clearings.
</p>

<p>
With unerring, quick-witted appraisal, the American
officer saw that he was outnumbered three to one, but
losing no time, he divided his company into three parts and
struck out from three directions of the woods, firing rapid
fire, making a great commotion and noise, to give the
impression of great numbers.
</p>

<p>
Most of the enemy troops were poorly disciplined and
poorly led in these days of the Fall campaign, and this ruse
of the three-cornered attack was carried through with such
colored theatrical effect that it scored complete success.
There was a brief fight, some good Americans shooting at
open, closely grouped targets, and the frightened Bolshviks
fled in disorder.  Not only were the Americans able to
relieve their threatened comrades, but the scattered Bolsheviks
were followed up to Verst Four Forty Five.

Where a mill flaps its awkward wings
</p>

<p>
This was the furthermost point of the advance, for soon
General Ironside assumed the office of Commander-in-Chief,
and the "offensive war" was heard of no more.  The
campaign became a stalemate, each side awaiting the opponent's
next move, and not till November did the Bolsheviks
become aggressive again.  Then they stormed the positions
with great determination, but all posts held and they were
thrown back with frightful loss.
</p>

<p>
The succeeding month, it was decided by the Allied
Command to capture Plesetskaya, so that the enemy might be
denied a base for winter movement, and the divergent Allied
forces of the Railway brought together.  But the effort
failed.  The Russian contingent that was to go on skis
around the left, fifteen miles to Emtsa, floundered helplessly,
became exhausted and funked out in the deep snow many
miles from their objective; also the auxiliary force at Shred
Mekrenga could not gain its ground; but most of all, the
failure was caused by the members of the Slavo-British
Allied Legion, who faithlessly deserted in large numbers
and went over to their countrymen, the Bolsheviks, with
full information of the Allied plans.
</p>

<p>
This marked the collapse of the invasion of Archangel,
and when the cold of winter had settled, the Red leaders
set busily about the task of planning the destruction of
the over-extended Allied lines on six unsupported fronts,
which could neither retire beyond Archangel, nor be
reinforced until the remote coming of spring.  It looked as
if the great military machine which Trotsky assembled,
would speedily crush Ironside's men, and the Moscow
newspapers announced that a million Red bayonets would hurl
the foreigners to the White Sea, and into it (although the
sea was then solid ice), but inexplicably strange, after the
failure of Plesetskaya, there were few stirring, winter days
on the Railway Front, except once, when a daring Bolshevik
raiding excursion on skis snatched one of the rear guns from
the French (who had been shamed into returning to the
front), destroyed it, and got away in the snow.
</p>

<p>
Major J. B. Nichols was at this Railway Front, a civilian
officer, and the only one of the Americans in senior
authority who appeared to possess a heart, and courage, and
unfogged discernment.  He early grasped the vain futility of
the whole campaign and no cajoling or flattery or threats
from Archangel could sway his refusal to engage a single
man in unavailing patrols through the ambushed forests
or in hazardous "blow-offs" between the contested lines,
that accomplished nothing save the sacrifice of life.  So for
the most part the winter defense was a routine of work on
the defenses, the dugouts and the fortifications, and necessary
reconnaissance parties over the trails, to watch the flank
approaches and to keep an eye on dangerous Bolshie Ozerki.
</p>

<p>
With ready methods of quick transportation, and an
increase in the garrison by the coming of the King's Own
Liverpools, it became possible to arrange spells of relief,
and in March the Americans went back to Archangel.
</p>

<p>
At the front it was different.  There was a tautness, a
hushed, dread expectancy in the air, and life, an uncertain
thing, was to be lived, like the Hedonist, for the day;
there was no time to analyze the causes of one's misery or
even to be more than dully conscious of it; pressing
urgencies, actual or imaginary, were always occurring, and they
crowded out all opportunities for contemplation and
introspection.
</p>

<p>
But there was no pressure in careless Archangel, where
harrowing care and disgusting, swinelike filth vanished with
a wave of fairy wand and lo, the war with Russia became
a magical heroic pageant.  Large numbers of unemployed
officers strolled the Troitsky Prospect, very merry and
bright, an array of bright, varicolored ribbons, like flower
gardens, flourishing on their well-arched military chests.
</p>

<p>
There was the American Supply Company at full strength,
which looked very sleek and smug, and groomed well, and
well fortified to withstand the rigors of the Arctic winter,
who displayed extraordinary capacity for trading with the
natives and astounding dexterity in the acquisition of an
affluent wealth of Russian rubles.
</p>

<p>
It made a soldier sick at heart to see the good things
stacked high at Bakaritza, the sweets and dainties and
tobacco that would have meant so much to the homesick Vaga
men and the far Dvina men who were never relieved&mdash;the
cases and cases of whisky piled in mountainous piles in the
warehouses at Bakaritza!
</p>

<p>
There were other cases (empty ones) outside the Officers'
Club.  And in the happy city, parties were held, with
sparkling jollity, and entertainments, and dances, and
jingling sleigh rides, and down the long toboggan run near the
domed cathedral roistering funmakers with screaming laughter
would glide through the exhilarating Arctic air to the
white world below.  The varied military were having a
rather unique and amusing time of it in jaunty galliard
Archangel, and none of the impassive Slavs there seemed
agitated or even interested in this war to bring peace to
"sad, distressed, and afflicted Russia," which had ended life
for many Americans and broken the lives of many more.
Russian soldiery was everywhere, Russian officers, with
gaudy uniform and restored Imperialistic hauteur; and Russian
soldiers drilling on the parade grounds, with a snap and
a smartness that was oddly British, all fit and well-fed
looking, capable of destroying untold American rations,
with the appearance of being able to shoulder a musket in
defense of their country if they were so minded, but with no
apparent intention of being so disposed.
</p>

<p>
Every soldier knew of the scene at Alexandra Nevsky
Barracks, where American machine guns were turned on the
S.B.A.Ls. to put down the revolt that occurred when our
Russian allies were ordered to the fighting front.  And
poignantly fresh was the memory of the faithless conduct
that had lost Plesetskaya in December.  Treachery at the
front, and treachery stabbing in rear!  Why should American
soldiers die and suffer exposure and hardship for these
heedless, indifferent people?
</p>

<p>
And if the fight was not for Russia, what was it for?
</p>

<p>
There were persistent rumors of a war to collect
imperialistic claims and money obligations, and other passing
rumors as errant and disordered as the Red Bolo Bolshevik
propaganda that begot them.  But was it altogether strange,
that after this had gone on for months and months, when
the soldier asked for the facts and the facts were denied him,
that he should begin to wonder, and to grow almost
embittered; that, in fact, one of the companies should give
audible expression to its turbulence?
</p>

<p>
During the last part of March, a convoy of sleighs drew
up before Smolny Barracks to carry this company and its
equipment over the frozen bay of Archangel to the station
where a train was waiting to take them to the Railway
Front.  But the men did not stir from their barracks, and
the equipment was not loaded, so that the colonel of the
American regiment came (somewhat hastily) from his warm
quarters to learn the reason for the delay.
</p>

<p>
The colonel assembled his soldiers in a large Y.M.C.A. hall,
and read them that Article of War which pronounces
death as the penalty for mutiny.  Then, following an
impressive stillness, he asked if there were any questions.
There were no inquiries concerning the Article of War,
which is terse, succinct and unequivocal, but one soldier
arose very respectfully and said:
</p>

<p>
"Sir, what are we here for, and what are the intentions
of the U.S. Government?"
</p>

<p>
The colonel very frankly replied he could not give a
definite answer to the question, but added, that regardless
of the purposes of the Expedition, it was now in acute
jeopardy of extinction, and the lives of all depended upon
successful resistance.  More silence followed.
</p>

<p>
There is a favorite disciplinary method of the military
based upon basic, elementary psychics.  It is invoked by all,
from the drill sergeant to the general officer.  The principle
is the antithesis of mob psychology, and goes upon the
presumption that man is a gregarious being.
</p>

<p>
At the first rumor of incipient disorder, soldiers are
assembled at attention, and any man holding to minority
views is commanded to step forward (usually three paces)
from the ranks and expound his convictions.
</p>

<p>
Great heroes and those capable of the highest, unparalleled
courage, quail at this test, for it is one thing to
rebel in company, or in the secret counsels of one's inner
conscience; quite another to stand out stark alone and
unsupported against the strong arm of the military, the harsh,
punitive, martial law of an intolerant warring nation, that
can brook no infringement of combat discipline.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, when the colonel had finished, no one accepted
his invitation to stand forth and declare his opposition, and
the meeting was dismissed with an order to load packs and
proceed to the railway.
</p>

<p>
The next day, the fury of the Bolshevik offensive which
swept the Vaga, and strove to realize Moscow's boast of
annihilation for the Expedition, burst at Verst Four Forty
Five where this "mutinous" company took the brunt of
the attack and never wavered during the ceaseless, storming
battles that followed, until, at the end of the third day, the
enemy sullenly retired, repulsed and defeated, and another
company relieved the exhausted American line.
</p>

<p>
And often before had these same men proved their mettle.
There was no finer company in the regiment than this, and
no more gallant officer than its commander.  It is not the
nature of the American to become "cannon fodder" without
a question.  Theirs was only the voice of sanity raised in
this madman's war; yet when they saw that all in Russia
were in the same plight, that no one knew the reason why,
that all were caught in the same meshes of inextricable folly,
they were soldiers, and played the soldier's part unfalteringly
until the untried Russian conscripts came in May.
</p>

<p>
Many Russians had been killed as enemies; so like these
simple peasants in soldier uniform that came to relieve the
contested lines in May; so like the bearded host under whose
foul-smelling roof the American dwelt.  They did not seem
soldiers; so spiritless, so immobile, so unmoved by firing
emotions in this civil war wherein foreign defenders had
died for Russia.  If they felt any gratitude, it was covered
beneath an exterior of impenetrable, Slavic lethargy, that
defied all effort to disrobe.  Life had been a thing of rote
with these moujiks, as constant as the law of seasons and
of stars, and the violent change from opaque darkness to
the dazzling light, left them blinded, befuddled, groping
for moral support.  Before they had commenced to grasp
the tremendous significance of the Revolution, swift came
the Bolsheviks, crashing to earth every vestige of law,
stability, the social structure, property rights.
</p>

<p>
Now followed these foreign invaders, warring upon the
Bolsheviks and speaking with high sounding, noble phrases
of saving Russia, as they burned moujik homes and turned
moujik women and children out upon the cold snows.  It
was too much for the poor serf's imagination.  From
fatalistic refuge he looked out on a howling storm-tossed
universe and abandoned all hope of comprehension.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nitchevoo</i>.  There was no reason left on earth.  All had
gone crazy; all were stark, raving madmen in a madman's
world!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
So did the curtain fall on this lurid melodrama and its
fretful Railway scene, and now that the heyday of the
fight was done, disquieting reflections took possession of the
Americans.  Their dead had died for a scant few miles on
this Railway battle ground, but what the paltry little gain
meant now not one could tell, nor why the fearful price was
paid, and ever came distracted thoughts of the futility of it
all, thoughts like howling, evil genie that ever recurred to
haunt and taunt those that came away.

ONEGA
</p>

<p>
General Ironside became Commander-in-Chief
of the North Russian Expedition at the commencement
of winter, and the "offensive war" forthwith came to
an abrupt termination, without ceremony.
</p>

<p>
At that time, one company of Americans and ninety-three
Slavic Legionaires composed the Onega or right wing
of the Allied army which was at Chekuevo, some hundred
and forty miles from Archangel on the Onega River.
</p>

<p>
A landing party of the original Poole force, expert rifle
marines from the United States warship, <i>Olympia</i>, had
taken the port of Onega after a noisy fight in September,
and a few days later, gave it over to this Russo-American
detachment, three hundred strong, whose object was to
accord right lateral support to the Railway Column, and
above all to safeguard the significant winter road connecting
the Railway with Onega, along which the winter mail came
sporadically, and the only reinforcements, three companies
of British Yorks, were brought from Murmansk during the
cold days of February.
</p>

<p>
As the Americans, verst post to verst post, fought their
way south along the Railway line, so this detachment went
forward at bloody experience and kept abreast, until the
Bolsheviks, following the Railway victory at Verst Four
Forty Five, grew cautious, and drew back up the Onega
Valley to Turchasova.
</p>

<p>
And when winter came, the forty miles between Turchasova
and Chekuevo, were a shadowy No Man's Acre along
the twisting, snow highway of the river, where hostile
patrols prowled, and life was held by uncertain tenure; but
the disputed ground was narrowed by half when the Americans
moved up part of their small number nearly midway to
the Bolshevik village, and took station at Kyvalanda, in
order to watch a southern trail inlet to the important
Railway road, along which were regularly dispatched visiting
patrols to the scattered villages of Bolshie Ozerki, that they
might hearten and keep contact with the few pathetic
Frenchmen and Allied Russians who made an audacious
pretense of maintaining a post there, and far off on the snow,
deserted many miles from the Railway, reminded one of a
choice morsel of tenderloin, baited for puma.
</p>

<p>
The Onega detachment joined in the operation for
Plesetskaya, which the new Commander-in-Chief, in furtherance
of his defensive policy of consolidation, was anxious to
take before the intense cold.
</p>

<p>
Plesetskaya was an important base, and had they lost it,
the Bolsheviks would have encountered great, almost
insurmountable obstacles, in bringing troops from Vologda, and
concentrating them in an aggressive winter warfare, for this
point was a junction of the principal highways leading from
the Railway line to Onega, Kochmas, Tarasovo and Shenkurst.
</p>

<p>
But this Allied advance failed, primarily for the same
cause that the whole Expedition failed, through ridiculous
paucity of numbers, and in the second instance (although
there were several more), because it was impossible to
maintain any semblance of liaison over the difficult lateral
terrain which separated the five Columns, theoretically
converging in the push for Plesetskaya.
</p>

<p>
So on New Year's day, after they had met the enemy
and soundly punished him in two sharp engagements, and
standing to, were about to drive him from his Turchasova
stronghold, the Onega Americans were given the disappointing
order to fall back and resume post at Chekuevo, where
long, black months followed, and life took on a grinding,
monotonous, drab, depressing atmosphere, lifted only by
an occasional, welcomed brush or "wind up," till lo, in
March, the sun shone high and streamed in extravagant,
effulgent light on the glaring snow fields, the days grew
longer and still longer, in this eccentric, topsy-turvy, North
world, and finally there were as few hours of darkness as
there had been of light a few months before.
</p>

<p>
Late in the month, a patrol was driven off from Bolshie
Ozerki by the shot from many rifles, and a combat party
the next day ran counter machine gun emplacements, was
extricated only by adroit leadership, and after worming a
long distance through the piling drifts.
</p>

<p>
It was learned then that the little garrison at Bolshie
Ozerki had been annihilated, but it was thought by a strong
raiding party, bent upon capture of the ration and
ammunition convoys between Onega and the Railway.  Not
yet was there a suspicion of the enemy's surprising, gigantic
manoeuvre, which with incomparable, superior force, sought
to turn the Allied flank at Obozerskaya, carry through to
the Dvina, fuse with the Bolshevik Vaga army, then sweep
on to Archangel and make good the Moscow boast to cast
every foreigner in North Russia into the White Sea.
</p>

<p>
The British Colonel, irritated by the enemy resistance at
Bolshie Ozerki, was determined to chastise "the raiders"
thoroughly, and felt very confident when his seventy
Americans were joined by the three companies of Murmansk
Yorks, which had marched one hundred and seventy miles
from Soroka on the Murman railway in the hope of reaching
the hard pressed Vaga Column, before it was too late.
</p>

<p>
The only access to Bolshie Ozerki from the west is a
wagon road, eighty feet wide, which cuts a swath through
the ambient forest.  Passing sleighs had packed this road
so that it gave good going, but at either side among the
trees was a hopeless, floundering snow bog nearly four
feet, and two miles out from the village, the Bolsheviks
had improvised an outguard, which swept this only
approach with machine guns that had the concentrated fire
of three battalions.
</p>

<p>
At dawn, on the twenty-fourth day of March, the Americans,
supported by the Yorks on either flank, crept through
the trees by the roadside to the attack on Bolshie Ozerki.
At five hundred yards, the enemy opened fire, a murderous
plunging storm of steel and lead that must completely quell
all thought of further approach, still none turned back;
dragging and pushing themselves through the snow by
knees and feet and elbows, the men made four hundred
yards; here the American officer was killed, two of the
British officers were hit and went down as if struck by
lightning, and it was seen by volume of the fire that the
odds were hopeless, yet the little company, facing utter
massacre, burrowed in the deep snow, and, in the stiffening
cold, hung on to the last round, till the retirement order
came at dusk; the sacrifice was a heavy one, but not in vain,
for by this devoted stand the stupendous nature of the
enemy operations to overwhelm the whole Expedition at
Bolshie Ozerki was fully revealed, and every man at the
rear position, vividly conscious of the desperate character
of the fight, steeled himself for the grim business in hand.
</p>

<p>
Back in Archangel, General Ironside saw in a flash that
the life of his army fluttered in the balance.  He scoured
the city for every available fighting man, collected the few
he could, a varicolored assemblage of Americans, British,
Allied Russians and a platoon of French mounted on skis&mdash;Le
Legion Courier du Bois&mdash;all counted, five hundred
eighty men, and rushed with them to the battle.  There,
this iron General, well knowing himself to be faced by great
unknown numbers, tossed caution high to the four winds.
He dragged his artillery over the snow from the railway
at Obozerskaya, and set it twelve miles off in the woods,
daring the enemy to capture it.  He brought out his
handful of divergent troops, and, smashing down trees, built
up rough barricades, a cordon about his guns; then, cut
off from all hope of accessible retreat, this fighting man,
whose fighting stuff had been welded among the Northwest
Mounted Police of the Canadian frontier, threw down the
challenge of wild death battle to the Slavs.
</p>

<p>
Very close, not even a mile away, down the Bolshie
Ozerki trail, the Bolsheviks had concentrated their artillery
and thrown out their advance works, and now commenced
a blasting duel between the opposing batteries that tossed
skyward mountainous geysers of snow, made fragments of
the trees, and, through every lighted hour, shook the forest
end to end with a ceaseless, reverberating roar, that pounded
upon the ear with the vindictive echoes of tortured damned
souls.
</p>

<p>
Fortune is a fickle mistress, but she loves the strong and
smiles her favor on the brave, and in this strange mad
Arctic forest fight, the Briton gained her countenance by
thus handsomely risking all at a throw, and by his dashing
courage, his magnificent, irresistible, reckless courage.
</p>

<p>
The Slav, more cautious, and overestimating the strength
opposing him (as the Bolsheviks did time after time), did
not strike while the iron was hot, but held off until he had
gathered together three regiments; the 2nd Moscow, the
96th Saratov, the 2nd Kasan and several companies of ski
troops; and the road that paralleled the Railway line to
the Bolshevik camp at Shelaxa, near Plesetskaya, became
a pitiful trailing havoc of dead and dying horses, driven
to exhaustion in hysterical haste to bring still more artillery,
more supplies, more ammunition to the waiting assault.
</p>

<p>
But every day spent by the Bolshevik chief, in fortifying
his attack, was bringing victory to Ironside.  In this
winter campaign, with lack of transportation and dwelling
quarters, it was always impossible to concentrate
overmastering numbers of troops without costly postponement
of the striking assault.  The most troops that could be
assembled were assembled by the Bolsheviks at the Vaga and
Bolshie Ozerki&mdash;probably eight thousand to ten thousand
at each place, and these were brought together with enormous
labor, incredible striving, heroic suffering in the cold,
which plundered the soldiers' strength, so that they were
weakened by privation and shaken by much exposure, and
in the case of Bolshie Ozerki, came to the fight too late.
</p>

<p>
So this battle that might have taken the life of the Allied
North Russian Expedition was lost, the fleeting opportunity
for success sped away when after the first fell stroke
the precious element of surprise was profligately squandered.
And the Americans, bracing themselves for the storm, fell
to under the engineers, and working night and day, erected
a citadel in the woods, strengthened the barricades and
actually finished two bullet proof blockhouses before the
first battle shock.  Immense stores of ammunition were
stacked high about the guns, and as the men labored, their
confident enthusiasm grew; every soldier, under the
stimulating, mesmeric influence of his great chief, knew, with
unwavering faith, that the fight was won, grew impatient
in the blood lust, and whetting his bayonet, waited like
a primitive savage, serene in the unshakable conviction
"that one Allied soldier was the equal of twenty Bolsheviks."  So,
in truth, he had to be in the battles of Bolshie
Ozerki.
</p>

<p>
It was a tactical custom of the enemy to attack the front
and rear positions, sometimes he struck both simultaneously,
but seldom the flanks.  Therefore, General Ironside placed
his Americans forward and back, where the gun emplacements
were, and then stood poised for the onslaught.  If
the law of averages traversed its orbital course, all might
be well, but if the Bolsheviks forsook their usual custom,
these dispositions might well prove fatal; for although the
Yorkmen were scattered among them as bolsters, the green,
Russian, Archangel troops on the flank positions were as
yet untried, and the presumption was against them in the
pending death fight that would give no quarter.
</p>

<p>
But when the enemy came at last, on the seventh day,
he came just as the General had speculated he would come
in an attack on the rear guns; then in greater strength
followed through at the front barricades.  The next dawn, at
three thirty o'clock, the full fury of the assault was
uncovered, as three swaying rows of men hurled themselves
forward like swelling, tidal waves, and when this forward
attack was at its climax, a wild horde stormed the rear.
</p>

<p>
In such an encounter, the great chance of success is in
overwhelming the weaker adversary by sheer preponderance
of numbers, to palsy his intelligence by bearing down on
him with an awesome multitude, and before he has recovered,
sweep him off his feet.  But with these Americans, there
was no such terror wrought hiatus, for the very intensity
of the situation seemed to electrify their fiber, and fire
their brains with the steady, blue flame of coordinated
intelligence; under these overwhelming tidal attacks these
fighting men were never so alert, never so keenly and
appraisingly aware of every event, never so thoroughly
mindful of every tense situation as it transpired; for they knew
that piling cumbersomely through those bogging snow
depths, the oncoming Bolsheviks were shackled nearly as
effectually as if bound with ankle ropes, and they were
acutely conscious of the verity, that in the circumstances,
one steady man behind a bullet proof barricade, deliberately
directing a functioning machine gun, had the weight of
three hundred rifles.
</p>

<p>
So now it was a glorious thing to be in the blockhouses
and the log barriers and to witness those human multitudes
surge on, then slacken, and falter and fail and shrivel as
they came, while machine guns swept them line to line,
and flank to flank, and piled the dead and left crumpled,
moaning heaps of men, where red, ugly blotches widened
on the snow.

The blockhouses where men were crippled and maimed and shell-shocked, <br />
far away from gala Archangel.
</p>

<p>
By noon, the fury of the storm had nearly subsided, the
Commander of the Saratov Regiment, thinking his troops
had won their ground, rode on his white horse nearly into
the defenses and was shot down as he came, and from this
time, the firing became desultory, except when some violent
commissar drove small groups forward to be killed, or
others, made desperate by despair, sneaked creeping out,
and so were killed, and the rest lay flattened on the snow,
not daring to go forward or back.
</p>

<p>
At nine, the sun went down upon the tumult of a bloody,
grewsome day; it became cold again, and there followed
dusky, unnatural silence, shattered occasionally by the
rasping crack of snipers' shots, where in that night of horrors,
the unfortunate Bolsheviks passed the acme of mortal
misery.  For if defeated, they returned to their own camp,
death was waiting for them, and ahead were the remorseless
Americans ready to shoot on sight, without stint of
mercy.  So, fairly caught between two fires, they lay out
through the endless, black hours of terrible cold and frost,
and gangrene took a greater toll than all the gunshot
wounds.
</p>

<p>
Yet great as was the enemy distress, all knew that when
the next day dawned, new forces would come up and press
on to another determined assault, and it was to divert as
many of these reinforcements as possible, that General
Ironside ordered the Onega Detachment to move against Bolshie
Ozerki from the west.
</p>

<p>
That same night, one of the York companies left the
Onega Detachment and followed an unreconnoitred trail
through the forest to strike again the hostile village from
the north at daybreak; but long before dawn, became
confused in the darkness and was hopelessly lost when the
attack began on the road where another British company
was to move against the village.  A Polish company of
Archangel volunteers, who were to execute a corresponding
south flank movement, came from Chekuevo too late, so
that the brunt of the fight fell upon the unsupported Yorks
on the road.
</p>

<p>
Thirty minutes after the first faint light, dogs, tied to
trees by the Bolsheviks, sighting the approaching front
attack, gave boisterous, barking alarm, and, on the instant,
the woods were made hideous with the rasping rattle of
many machine guns.  Many of the little band were hit in
this first storm, but the rest kept on, dragging themselves
through the yielding, four foot snow, while inches over
their heads, the air howled hideously with the passage of
flying death.  In the snow, rifles became clogged in the
breeches, so that the bolts would not drive home, and men
had to dig them clean with fingers stiffening from cold,
but still, a little at a time, the attack wormed on and on.
At one hundred yards, the gallant, British captain rose to
lead a rush at the machine gun positions and was killed
in his tracks; then the second officer was hard hit, and
when the delayed Polish company came forward in support,
and two of its number got shot through the bowels,
the others bolted like sheep and could not be driven to the
battle again.
</p>

<p>
Then the Yanks went in and stood manfully to the fight
by the side of their distressed comrades, but against heart
sickening, desperate, despairing odds, as the merging
Bolsheviks came from both sides and massed in a vicious,
determined counter attack that would have overcome all, but
when doom seemed certain, the lost York Company emerged
from the woods, by some act of a benevolent Providence,
to meet and stay the fullness of the thrust, until darkness
came down to save the valiant, little band on the snows.
</p>

<p>
This last, noble effort of the Onega Detachment had been
made with a single thought&mdash;that of baring their breasts
to the blow that otherwise would have fallen on their tired
comrades in the barricades out in the forest from Obozerskaya;
and great as the cost, its effect had been the final
discouragement to the Bolsheviks who made one more
ineffectual effort to gain the Allied Railway flank, then drew
back in full retirement to the south.
</p>

<p>
The enemy sustained great losses in these battles of
Bolshie Ozerki, upwards of two thousand casualties, many of
them from the frost, for the villages could shelter but a
fraction of the large forces, and many had to live in such
makeshift quarters as could be devised.
</p>

<p>
Time was of the essence in this undertaking of the
Bolshevik commander, and he had paused when he should
have struck out with every man in his control, but by his
dalliance, spring joined the league of his enemies.  Soon
the freezing clutch of winter would be broken in the warm
sun, and, unless he hastened to withdraw to the south, his
artillery would be mired in the yielding roads.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In June, the new, conscripted, Russian soldiers came to
take Onega's posts, and the heavily-tired Americans went
back to assembly at Archangel, buoyant and bright-eyed
at the prospect of home, till they met on the city streets
a few invalided Category B Scots going back to the battle
lines, because the Bolo droves were gathering again and
every man was needed there.  Then the light smile passed
from the lips of the Americans, a blush came to their cheek,
home was forgotten and all thought of home; for there was
a man's work out in the forest swamps far to the south&mdash;where
death lurked and misery waited; and hardly a man
who would not have chosen the swamps with their physical
suffering and their ambushed death than escape and bear
the stinging reproach of deserting a mate in distress.  Better
to play the wretched game through to the uttermost end
than to be faithless to the traditions of one's blood, to quit
the field with the honor of a nation stained and shamed
in burning disgrace.
</p>

<p>
For was this such a flagitious, disgraceful brawl in which
their mates had bled their manhood blood away that American
soldiers should sneak from it thus, like cuffed and
beaten mongrel curs?
</p>

<p>
Time, soothing time, will smooth with gentle, cooling
fingers, the harsh lines of fretful hardship, the distressful
burdens of campaign and trying vigils of sleepless peril,
and even burn a purple halo of romance about this miserable,
petty, little war, but some hurts the assuaging balm
of time can never heal.
</p>

<p>
Many had cast off at the call of country and given all
with generous unstinting affection, and those who were
coming back did not begrudge the sacrifice; but rankling
deep forever in the living consciousness of every Archangel
soldier is the thought of this ignoble quitting and the weak
abandonment by his country of everything to which he
had pledged his manhood faith.&mdash;The causelessness of it
all&mdash;Alarming, unbalancing reflections, a moral devastation
that will not be quieted&mdash;Corroding grief for those
who flushed with promise were "taken from life when life
and love were young" in a shabby brawl for nothing.&mdash;A
dangerous cynical bitterness is with the soldier of North
Russia, mordant and enduring, that grows ever more bitter
with the years.

<p class="intro">
SUBJECT: <i>Withdrawal of American troops from
Archangel</i>.
</p>

<p class="intro">
Dear Colonel House:
</p>

<p class="intro">
The 12,000 American, British and French troops at
Archangel are no longer serving any useful purpose.
Only 3,000 Russians have rallied around this force.
</p>

<p class="intro">
Furthermore, they are in considerable danger of
destruction by the Bolsheviki.
</p>

<p class="intro">
The appended memorandum and map which General
Churchill has prepared show that unless the ice
in the White Sea suddenly becomes thicker, it is possible
at present, with the aid of six icebreakers, which
are now at Archangel, to move these troops by water
to Kem on the Murmansk Railway, whence they may
be carried by train to Murmansk.
</p>

<p class="intro">
The situation at Archangel is most serious for the
soldiers, but it is also serious for the Governments
which seem to have abandoned them.  Unless they are
saved by prompt action, we shall have another Gallipoli.

KODISH
</p>

<p>
Kodish was the epitome of North Russia.  Bought
with toiling effort, incredible privation and cruel losses,
to be lost and won again time following time in the
bitter-most winter days with moving heroism and a moral
grandeur that at times reached a sublime estate&mdash;it was in the
end abandoned as "of no especial military significance."
</p>

<p>
The village lay in the course of the Imperial road from
Petrograd that parted from the Vologda railway at
Plesetskaya and cut a diagonal lane through the province
north-easterly to Emetskoe on the Dvina.  Both Commands
stressed its importance.  In the early days of the campaign
the Allied leaders, bent upon conquest, seized upon it as
an opportune route to support the railway invasion by
surprising the enemy in rear, while the Bolshevik Staff saw
a chance to drive a wedge between the two advancing
Columns and effectually deny the River forces all
communications.
</p>

<p>
A typical polyglot group of French, British, friendly
Russians, and a few American marines, some two hundred
in all, had gone out from Archangel in the first days of
the Expedition to Seletskoe on the Emtsa river determined
to drive south from this subsidiary base along this
Petrograd road to Plesetskaya.  This group, designated "D
Force" to distinguish it from "A Force" on the Railway
and "C Force" on the Dvina, and the Vaga, had hardly
commenced its daring operation when an urgent call for
succor caused British, French and Americans to hurry across
a trail through the swamps to Obozerskaya, leaving the
loyal Russians as rear guard before Kodish.  But the former
never reached their goal.  Days passed and nothing was
heard from them until a relief contingent, out a day's
journey from the Railway front in the forest swamps, found
in the midst of scattered infantry gear and other signs of
desperate encounter the soiled diary of an American sailor
with the epitaph of this illfated "B Force" written on
30th August.
</p>

<p>
The rescue party continued east through the swamps to
Seletskoe as the pursuing Bolsheviks closed in on that
village, but the Americans, reinforced by a slender garrison,
drove them south over the Emtsa, where they stood their
ground behind a destroyed bridge.  It was suicidal to
attempt a passage of the open river in the face of machine
guns, so the Americans dug in the cold sodden ground, and
in the grim siege that followed the suffering was intense;
no doctor was at hand to care for the many casualties who
were given crude first aid (when they were reached), and
bumped and jolted thirty torturing miles to Seletskoe, yet,
in the face of all these things, none at Kodish knew thought
of weakening or turning back.
</p>

<p>
On the ninth day, long awaited supports came up, a
crossing was effected at an unexpected point below the
Bolshevik position, and Kodish succumbed to a courage
that would not be denied.  Exposed baldly in a broad
clearing and flanked by three dominating hills, this moujik
village was helpless against modern artillery.  The French
colonel pronounced it "strategically untenable," but the
worst feature was its opportunity for complete encirclement.
This was brought vividly to the consciousness of
the Americans soon after their occupation when great
Bolshevik bands converged on them from villages to the south
and the Shred-Mekrenga trail, and following a four days'
battle, they fought for their lives in a night flight nearly
two miles along the road back across the river.
</p>

<p>
There the old familiar siege tactics were resumed.  The
engineers with a genius of adaptitude built a fortress of
blockhouses on the north Emtsa embankment, and in these,
one company of Americans, augmented by a few British
infantry and a section of Canadian Field Artillery, stood
off the Bolsheviks from the crucial Petrograd road.  In
December, with Plesetskaya the objective of three Allied
fronts, this little group, now 450 strong, led by the
impetuous "Major Mike" Donaghue forced twenty-seven
hundred Bolsheviks out of Kodish, but could make little
progress on the road beyond.  So the contested village was held
as an advanced post for the main Allied force on the Emtsa,
and exposed to unremitting bombardment from many
superior guns, became an inferno of bursting shells.
</p>

<p>
Once on a black January night, it was abandoned by
the little outpost and set aflame, but before dawn,
Donaghue was back with his men to a chaos of charred ruins,
like the skeleton of a beast of prey in a desert of snow,
through which the bitter, chill winds wailed dolefully.  In
these deserted Kodish streets of abject desolation, the
American soldier knew the uttermost depths of physical misery
experienced during the whole winter campaign.
</p>

<p>
The Commander-in-Chief came to the Kodish front when
British soldiers evinced a truant disposition and would not
"carry on" unless certain interrogatories concerning this
evasive war with Russia were answered.  The interrogatories
were addressed to Premier Lloyd George and were
such as might arise from the mental consciousness of any
men who still have well poised, wholesome regard for life
and the pursuit of happiness as they understand it.  These
British soldiers had come from the winter murk of
Murmansk, had emerged from four years' hell in France, and
saw themselves the hapless forfeit in a confused
international melee without wit or reason at a time when all
were thoroughly sickened with war and thought they merited
restoration to their homes.  But when the soldier Ironside,
six feet four, with "an eye like Mars to threaten and
command" had spoken, the interrogatories were all
forgotten and these disgruntled men, who had uttered mutiny,
returned to the fight with a matchless valor; with a
steadfastness that gave never ceasing wonderment that they
could so freely offer all with every instinct and inclination
opposed.

<p>
It was at Kodish that the Bolsheviks strove their
uttermost with propaganda, that insidious, warring weapon of
which so often they have revealed themselves the masters.
Thousands and thousands of pamphlets, leaflets, circulars,
manifestoes, announcements, proclamations, appeals&mdash;an
amazing collection of vitriolic, eloquent literature, were
left along the patrol routes in the snow forests.  This was
true at all fronts, but especially at Kodish, where these
persuasive methods were concentrated like a great verbal
bombardment, a veritable war of scarifying words, Russian,
French, German and English.  Many messages of hate and
fire, with frank artlessness, urged the Allied soldier to
desert and join the Soviet; others, more subtle, displayed a
masterful knowledge of human weakness and human passions
and prejudices.

<p class="quote">
Do you British working men know what your capitalists
expect you to do about the war?  They expect you to go
home and pay in taxes figured into the price of your food
and clothing, eight thousand millions of English pounds
or forty thousand millions of American dollars.  If you
have any manhood, don't you think it would be fair to call
all these debts off?  If you think this is fair, then join the
Russian Bolsheviks in repudiating all war debts....
</p>

<p class="quote">
Do you realize that the principal reason the British-American
financiers have sent you to fight us for, is because
we were sensible enough and courageous enough to
repudiate the war debts of the bloody, corrupt old Tsar?...
</p>

<p class="quote">
You soldiers are fighting on the side of the employers
against us, the working people of Russia.  All this talk
about intervention to "save" Russia amounts to this, that
the capitalists of your countries are trying to take back
from us what we won from their fellow capitalists in
Russia.  Can't you realize that this is the same war that you
have been carrying on in England and America against
the master class?  You hold the rifles, you work the guns
to shoot us with, and you are playing the contemptible
part of the scab.  Comrade, don't do it!...
</p>

<p class="quote">
You are kidding yourself that you are fighting for your
country.  The capitalist class places arms in your hands.
Let the workers cease using these weapons against each
other, and turn them on their sweaters.  The capitalists
themselves have given you the means to overthrow them,
if you had but the sense and the courage to use them.  There
is only one thing that you can do: Arrest your officers.
Send a committee of your common soldiers to meet our
own workingmen, and find out yourselves what we stand
for.

<p>
The following is from the same publication:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
The Bolshevik Revolution marked the culmination of
the world struggle to set us all free.  Strike off your
shackles, comrades, we are your friends not enemies, and the
only reason we seek to stamp out the parasitical capitalists
by force is because force is the only language they can
understand.  This is the beginning of a great world
revolution which knows no national limitations.  It will set the
producers free.  Join the Soviet Party.  We are fighting
your fight against the unprincipled capitalistic class.
Comrades, you know the meaning of "scab," well, that is the
part you are acting in Russia.  For shame, comrades!  Kill
your officers, then shoulder your rifles and come over to
our lines which are your own.

<p>
These extracts have been taken at random from a hundred
others of like incendiary tenor, most of which had
little effect on the Americans except to impress them with
the coincidence of a striking similarity in style and
sentiment between them and many public addresses of American
politicians printed in the newspapers that came from home,
where a soft going government tolerated perversions of
free speech, as hostile to American soldiers in Russia as the
most violent preachments from the enemy.
</p>

<p>
A huge bulletin board was erected on the Bolshevik bank
of the Emtsa river, which conducted daily classes in
doctrines of International Revolution, and the first
confirmation of the Armistice news came in a weird preternatural
voice which startled the night stillness of Kodish by
announcing in sonorous tones the cessation of infamous war
and the restoration of peace to the afflicted peoples of earth.
There on the Emtsa bridge, a Bolshevik orator, shrouded
by the phantom shadow of a waning moon, delivered in
excellent English, almost academic in polish, a rhetorical
harangue on the glories of communism, the injustice of
soldiers suffering in cold swamps while others sat back in
Archangel in soft ease.  Also the speaker described most
persuasively the abundant, bountiful hospitality awaiting
all within the Soviet lines.  It was all very diverting, but
nevertheless gave audible utterance to many of the
disquieting reflections which rankled deep in the heart of every
man in the Allied ranks and did not go towards helping
Allied morale.  Later that same night, when this extraordinary
speech was ended, two captives, a Scot and an American,
came out on the bridge to tell their comrades of
benevolent treatment at the hands of the unspeakable enemy;
in the darkness their voices were like those from the grave,
for many soldiers were led to believe that the barbarous
Bolos killed all prisoners after torturing them with
frightful savagery.
</p>

<p>
In the first stages of the campaign, the French on the
Railway killed those that could not be carried off the field
to spare them the grewsome horrors which would have been
visited upon them by the enemy, yet at Ust Padenga,
volunteers brought in wounded not a hundred yards in front of
Bolshevik machine guns, and at Toulgas, after a disastrous
ambush, the enemy mysteriously withheld his fire from a
relief party that was entirely exposed.  There was, in fact,
only one recorded instance of atrocity.  This was on the
Vaga where the bodies of an officer and several Americans
were found hacked and mutilated with hideous debauchery,
but there was nothing to show that this barbarism was
approved by the Bolshevik leaders, and it may have been only
an uncontrollable manifestation of primal cruelty which
underlies all war.
</p>

<p>
Several months after the last troops left Archangel, a
number of Americans "missing in action" were expatriated
through the efforts of the Red Cross by way of Finland,
and these men spoke very favorably of their considerate
treatment in Moscow.

THE RIVER
</p>

<p>
Half of the original Poole Expedition was selected
for the punitive pursuit down the railway, a garrison
was left to guard Archangel, and the trifling group
that remained followed the dark course of the Dvina into
the unknown region of the interior.  There were told off
for this river expedition two depleted companies of the
Tenth Royal Scots Regiment, and twenty-five of the American
marines crowded into merchant barges and towed slowly
up-stream by small tugs.  The only escort was an armored
British monitor, and seen from the shore, as they made their
toilsome struggling way against the swift racing river course,
conspicuous, unshielded targets on its broad surface, the
dauntless little band looked tempting ambush prey.
</p>

<p>
At Chamova, some one hundred and eighty miles from
Archangel, the enemy gave sign of having abruptly recovered
from his first stampede.  He turned and showed his
fangs, and the pursuit stopped short.
</p>

<p>
It now grew apparent that the retreat had not been as
riotous as first supposed; in fact, there was good reason to
believe that it was a part of Bolshevik strategy, and
evidence was accumulating that Trotsky had ordered the
withdrawal from Archangel to make certain of the millions
of American made supplies and ammunition, had taken
a careful appraisal of the military situation, and elected
to give battle in the interior.  When the Americans
arrived they were met at the wharf by an agitated Brass
Hat who said the Allies at both fronts were standing at
bay and the situation had assumed a very precarious phase.
</p>

<p>
The Third Battalion was rushed to the Railway, and
the First Battalion, in dirty, ill-smelling barges, followed
the pioneer Poole Expedition up the river one hundred and
fifty miles to Bereznik.  These barges had carried many
cargos on Dvina's waters, cargos of livestock and flax and
other agricultural produce, but were new to human freight,
and in their cramped, miserable, dank quarters, the scourging
influenza broke out afresh among the troops, and those
who had already been weakened by the disease grew fainter
and fainter as they followed up the unknown waterway till
a day came when one after one they quietly passed to the
bourne of that country of gentle unwaking sleep, and
sometimes off on the gloomy foreboding river the passage of
this antic caravel seemed more a funeral processional than
an aggressive expedition of war.
</p>

<p>
The tired comrades who were even denied the vibrant
thrill of the fight, and its doubtful glory, were with simple
soldier ceremonials given to the soil of Russia, ceremonials,
moving because of their simplicity and that wholesome,
fullhearted sentimentalism which has always marked the
American character&mdash;and always must be of our America.
</p>

<p>
Here in these little churchyards, tragic death seemed
robed in sorrow more sacred with the brown, barren
embankments like a shroud of mourning, the grave skies
drooping and disconsolate and the sombre recesses of the forest
where taps trailed in grieving cadences and echoed within
the soldier's spirit long after its last note had been lost in
the gloom.  Laden with inarticulate depression and confused
melancholy, thoughts of life's crazy theatre, the crushing
power and immensity of fate, the tragedy of all, these men
fresh from the fields and shops of Michigan and Wisconsin
groped their dazed way back to the barges where dark
shadows with ominous fingers reached over the waters and
death, in this haunting, melodramatic land waited,
suspended in the alien air like a pestilential vapor.
</p>

<p>
The first stop was five days out from Archangel at Bereznik,
near the junction of the Dvina and its main tributary,
the Vaga.  Here there was a group of commodious, well
constructed log buildings, which had served as hunting
lodges for the Tsar Nicholas and his retinue during the
days of the Romanoff dynasty.  It was decided to make
use of these buildings for storage purposes, and to have
Bereznik as the subsidiary base of the Dvina expedition
until progress was made so far up the river that practical
considerations would impel the movement of the subsidiary
base to a more advanced position.
</p>

<p>
So from the time of the arrival of the Americans on the
13th September, until the close of water at the end of
October, rations, munitions, clothing and other accouterments
of war, in value over one million pounds sterling,
which had been brought all the way from England, were
loaded on every craft that could be commandeered at
Archangel and transported the one hundred and fifty miles to
Bereznik.
</p>

<p>
One of the American companies was left to guard these
precious supplies and the others hurried on to take up the
gage of offensive campaign.  There was a brush at Chamova,
but the enemy did not make his first stand until he
came to Seltzo, nearly thirty miles further upstream, and
now well over two hundred miles from far away Archangel.
Except on the Vaga, this was the furthermost south
achieved by the Allied troops.
</p>

<p>
At Seltzo, it became clear that the Soviets had no
intention of running further, and that the foreigners would be
fortunate if they held the ground already gained.  The
tactical abandonment of Archangel having accomplished
the effective seizure and retention of everything of value
in that port and extended the invader far into the interior,
revealing with obliging frankness his numerical weakness,
had realized the ends sought by the Bolsheviks, and the
signs were now many that they intended to strike back and
strike back hard.
</p>

<p>
Why did not Poole retire to Archangel?
</p>

<p>
The futility of the attempt to reach the distant Siberian
railway with the ridiculously small force at the disposal
of the Allied Commander was glaringly apparent to every
common soldier.
</p>

<p>
Why did not Poole, like Joffre at the Marne, shift his
policy to meet the exigencies of the military situation, draw
in his far scattered fronts to Archangel, construct an
enceinte of defenses about the city, and hold on until help
came in the spring, or until some definite action was
determined for Russia?
</p>

<p>
Many lives would have been spared and much misery
averted had this been done, but the lives of a few men, and
the permanent impairment of the lives of many more, do
not weigh heavily in the scales with those who sit in the
councils of the inner sanctum at General Headquarters and
think nothing of the spending of divisions and even army
corps.  Perhaps it would have been too galling to
Anglo-Saxon pride to admit being on the defensive before an
inferior people like these poor Slavs who were to be
chastised with thoroughness and dispatch.  Then, too, it was
always safer for Archangel to have the outposts far into
the country, and flattered the Allied Command in the
belief of still being the aggressor.
</p>

<p>
When Ironside took command he not only conceded that
the Allies were conducting a defensive campaign, but with
soldier bluntness declared that the Expedition was in gravest
peril.  It was too late then to draw in the far dispersed
battalions.  They would have to fight it out on the wide
separated snowbound fronts, and show by deeds the
superiority of the Anglo-Saxon.  If they failed, if they were
faint hearted and even so much as faltered, the entire force
was doomed.
</p>

<p>
On the morning of 19th September battle was joined
at Seltzo.  A mile of open marsh lies outside, through which
the stream at the border of the village meanders from the
forest to pay tribute to the mighty Dvina.  The only easy
approach is along a narrow road that parallels the river
and crosses a bridge over this deep icy stream.  On this
morning of battle the Americans waded the swamp until
within fifteen hundred yards, when suddenly from the
scattered concealment of the houses there burst such a furious
fusillade of musketry and machine guns and Pom Pom
guns that they dropped low in their tracks and could go
no further.
</p>

<p>
Two other companies moved through the woods on the
flank to assist the frontal attack, but their location was
determined by the enemy batteries, and his infantry laid
down such a withering fire, that the battalion, exhausted
from a day of fighting and a heart-breaking march,
without rations and with no cover from the cold and the
drizzling rain, was compelled to bivouac that night in the
soaking morass, hopeful that with next morning would come
promised artillery support, for without it further advance
was unthinkable.
</p>

<p>
All through the night the Bolshevik guns searched for
the Americans who were new to combat, ignorant of the
ground, and had not an inkling of the enemy strength or
his fortifications or dispositions.  And at dawn a
reconnaissance patrol stumbled into a large enemy force, was
scattered and came back with no information, save that
the Bolsheviks had assembled in superior numbers and
were well supplied with ammunition.  As daylight broadened,
the shelling from the river became so violent that
the attackers had to choose between a further advance or
complete retirement; to stay where they were meant
destruction.
</p>

<p>
So with grave misgivings the attack was renewed, although
there was still no sign of promised artillery support;
machine guns guarding a trench system in the woods killed
and wounded many Americans, but the advance would
not give ground, and supporting comrades at flank and
rear kept up such a sustained unfailing fire that the
Bolsheviks were led to believe that the attack had been
replenished during the night.
</p>

<p>
During the fight the American lieutenant colonel "caught
in a bracket" had stayed in the rearward village,
Yakovlevskaya, but at dusk he emerged with the important Field
Pieces which laid down an effective <i>feu de barrage</i> on Seltzo.
Hardly had it lifted when the battalion arose and with
splendid dash and gallantry stormed forward to the village,
entered it and took possession.  But the story of Seltzo is
the story of the whole campaign.  After the infantry, with
inspiring display of courage and at great cost, had gained
a position, its small forces would be drafted for some other
distant hard-pressed front, or the position would be left
to the mercy of the Bolshevik guns until no course was
left except evacuation.
</p>

<p>
The monitor which had convoyed the battalion up the
Dvina, fearful of being caught by the ice that was expected
to creep upstream from Archangel at the beginning of
October, but did not actually come until mid-November, went
back before the battle and was gone for the duration of
the winter.  A few days after the battle, the artillery left
and was seen no more at Seltzo.  Also Headquarters ordered
two of the companies to proceed to Shenkurst on the Vaga,
the second city in the Province, where it was alleged a
large number of Russians in sympathy with the Allied cause
were anxious to have a garrison of American troops during
the approaching winter.
</p>

<p>
So it came that there was no artillery to avenge the
smashing havoc of the enemy heavy guns in this furthermost
Dvina village where one infantry company of Scots,
a like number of Americans, and a few Allied Russians
held on under terrific shell fire that from river and forest
racked and battered them.
</p>

<p>
The enemy had a complete battery of three inch pieces,
which he was free to bring up to the edge of the woods
beyond the village, and down the river on rafts and
improvised gunboats he floated three six inch guns and two
Nine Point Two naval pieces, and for days with this
combined armament he smashed and blasted until many of the
houses became a riot of shredded and splintered timbers,
and it was only a question of time before the garrison would
be decimated utterly.
</p>

<p>
On 14th October the Bolsheviks attacked the defensive
positions with great vigor, but were thrown back in
complete repulse with many killed; yet that night and in the
first morning hours the defenders slipped away in the
darkness, for under unhindered bombardment the place had
become a death's trap where all must eventually perish.
</p>

<p>
After this escape in the night there was a heart-breaking
drag through the mud, until late the next day the tired
Allied soldiers found harbor in Toulgas some fifteen miles
back.  Toulgas is typical of the North Russian village, a
group of bedraggled log houses huddled together on a hill,
which bends down in a long easy slope to the plain, where,
like Seltzo, a stream comes out of the forest and margins
another cluster of huts on the flat ground which the moujiks
call Upper Toulgas.
</p>

<p>
This stream is deep and numbingly cold, and has cut
an abrupt channel through the yielding soil so that
fording it is a difficult feat at best.  For an enemy to make
the attempt in daylight would be suicidal.  In darkness,
any considerable numbers cannot fail to give the alarm.
A road comes down from the hill and crosses a wooden
bridge to the forward village.  Watching the bridge is
the inevitable white church, and its gaudy minarets,
consciously aloof and superior in the poverty of the scene.
In the setting of dun barren ground the white edifice flashes
in undefiled purity against a low shrouding sky, more black
than gray, which rests upon the darker tufted forest.

The fighting Canadians
</p>

<p>
Across the road is the priest's house, like the others of
bark stripped logs, differing from the others only in its
greater size.  With a little barricading the walls of the
priest's house were secure against the lead of small guns,
but it was death to stay there during the avalanche of
high explosive shells that was poured out by the Bolshevik
gunboats.
</p>

<p>
After the battle of Armistice Day, the bearded priest
of Toulgas Church was found amid the hideous battle litter
of his wrecked home, the crown of his head cut clean as
with a scalpel, exposing the naked brains.  Near him were
two children, a boy and a girl, sleeping by the guardian
who from infancy had taught them of a Providence who
watched over the good of earth, and surely would not desert
them through this malignant turmoil that had descended
to the quiet moujik country with terrible death and
indescribable misery like the recurrent plagues.  So sleeping,
a shell had found the unconscious children, and lulled them
to that everlasting sleep.  The big shells had a way thus,
of stealthily sniping their victim's life away with no mark
of their dread approach, as if disdaining the brutality of
violence.  But again they would pounce down with the
atrocity of a fiend, smash head from trunk, and members
from the torso, and leave great gaping wounds gushing
black blood with unspeakable, horrible ghastliness.
</p>

<p>
Back of the church, on the same side of the road, is a
moujik house with the customary stable attached in rear.
A platoon used this as billeting quarters.  It was shielded
by the church forward, and gave shelter to the little reserve
that would replenish the blockhouse at the bridge with
men and ammunition, and, if the blockhouse was knocked
out, would stand off the Bolsheviks from crossing the bridge.
</p>

<p>
From the billet house to the church is about thirty yards.
The priest's house is nearly opposite the church across the
road.  The blockhouse was built just before the Armistice
fight and stands on the bank of the stream guarding the
bridge about twenty yards forward of the priest's house.
It is thirty yards over the bridge, and in front of the first
line of Upper Toulgas houses, a field, shorn of all cover,
stretches one hundred yards to the stream.
</p>

<p>
Back of the center village on the hilltop the ground
undulates almost unnoticeably in a series of folds and reaches
a shallow draw.  A little beyond this, perhaps two hundred
fifty yards, is still another clump of huts known as Lower
Toulgas.  In this draw, the Canadians built emplacements
for their two Field Pieces, which during the first battles
were the only artillery for the defense of Toulgas.
</p>

<p>
The forest gives way for nearly a half a mile before
Upper Toulgas.  From Upper Toulgas to Lower Toulgas
is an ample two miles.  From Toulgas, itself, the center
village, to Lower Toulgas is a scant three-quarters of a mile.
</p>

<p>
On the forest flank the ground has been cleared for a
space, varying from three hundred to less than sixty yards.
This clearance is greatest opposite the upper village.  In
the lower village it narrows, until in rear the trees close
in on the road that leads back to Bereznik and Archangel,
affording excellent opportunity of concealment and
surprise attack for an enemy that would have the endurance
and the hardihood and the courageous daring to march
through the deep swamps of the woods.
</p>

<p>
On the left the Dvina spreads out in a wide expanse,
two miles.  Opposite the rear and center villages the river
banks are high and steep, nearly precipitous, but at the
forward village on the flat ground the level is only a few
feet above that of the water.  Across the river there is not
the slightest sign of cover as far as the distant embankment
on the opposite shore.  The chances for surprise from
this quarter are practically none, and without surprise,
infantry advancing over the waist-deep snow against machine
guns, would have to be possessed of fanatical courage and
be in overwhelming strength.  The river could be nearly
neglected as a source of danger.
</p>

<p>
To defend the three Toulgas villages we had: One
company of American infantry; one company of Royal Scots
infantry, and one section of Field Artillery, manned by
fifty-seven Canadians.
</p>

<p>
In command of this force was Robert P. Boyd, an American
civilian, who, scarcely a year before, had graduated
with the rank of captain of infantry from a three months'
officers' training school at Fort Sheridan, Illinois.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after occupation of Toulgas, ice choked off
navigation of the lower river, and replenishments of supplies
and ammunition had to be brought by small one pony
sleighs from Bereznik.  The distance was some fifty miles,
and the journey by Russian pony was usually two days,
but when the snow was deepest, the weather bitterly cold,
and the days had but few hours of light, it took three days.
</p>

<p>
There was a field hospital at Bereznik, vicariously
supplied, and attended by a medical personnel of changing
nationality, British, Russian and American by turns.
</p>

<p>
We converted one of the huts of Lower Toulgas village
into a dressing station, where first aid was given the
wounded; but we had no facilities, no operating equipment, or
surgeons, or surgical instruments to care for the serious
cases.  If a soldier was hard hit and lived, he had to be
brought to Bereznik.
</p>

<p>
Following the retreat down river from Seltzo, there was
hardly time for a tactical survey of the situation, for the
construction of temporary redoubts on the forest flank and
at the crucial bridge, when enemy gunboats opened fire
on our positions and for three days kept up a determined
bombardment.  When dusk came on the third day, the
shelling lifted, and when the night grew black there was
a roar of many rifles and a mad yelling from the woods as
a horde of Bolsheviks fell on the center village.  In the
darkness and wild confusion, the tumult of battle made by
the roar of musketry, the shouting and screaming of many
foreign voices sounded like the onslaught of a Division.
</p>

<p>
But, even with the advantage of overpowering numbers,
a night attack to succeed, demands most accurate knowledge
of the enemy position, and most rigid control by a
leader of his men.  The Bolsheviks were not thoroughly
trained in these early days, although later they displayed
impressive military skill and the utmost cooperation
between officers and men; now their lead went high and
shrieked through air several feet above the heads of the
unscathed Americans, who had concealed Lewis guns in a
dugout at the point of the enemy rush and turned these
loose upon the massed Bolsheviks, felling them like cattle
in a slaughter pen.  One American private, swinging an
automatic rifle from his hip, shot until there was a
semi-circle of prostrate forms before him, some of them fifteen
yards away; and once a few of the enemy came so close
that they were spitted at the end of the bayonet.
</p>

<p>
At the height of the fight the Canadians opened up their
guns and rained the woods with shrapnel which threw the
wavering Bolsheviks into worse commotion and disorder,
for while the Lewis guns scattered death in front, rattling
shrapnel bullets threatened death in rear, and thus, huddled
together in the darkness like stampeded sheep, they were
shot down until the fierce exulting battle yells were changed
to moans of the wounded and appealing cries for mercy.
</p>

<p>
At a signal, the Canadian guns ceased firing, the Royal
Scots, shooting low and true, went into the counter, and
the disorganized Bolsheviks, seized with blind animal
terror, lost all semblance of order and fled in violent flight,
each man for himself, to the sheltering recesses of the forest.
</p>

<p>
After this night attack there was nearly a fortnight of
quiet on the Dvina, with no outward sign to show the enemy
intentions.  Patrols went out into the woods and came
back with the report that Zastrovia, the nearest village
upstream, was clear of hostile troops; but, while the Allied
Command took under advisement the opposing contentions
of retirement and holding on, the Bolsheviks were
assembling large fresh forces of infantry, and bringing heavy
guns from Krasnoborsk, preparatory to striking the most
ambitious blow yet attempted.
</p>

<p>
All at Toulgas were aware that the lull was ominous.
All knew that this phase of security was a very transient
one, and directed by the American engineers, every man who
was not on guard duty, worked building log blockhouses, at
tactical strong points about the center village, one of them
to guard the bridge over the stream to the upper village,
where there was a small outpost, which in case of frontal
attack was to give the alarm, then retire to the defenses.
</p>

<p>
The defense centered around the middle village.  There
were no fortifications to protect Lower Toulgas, and the
Canadians in the draw in front of Lower Toulgas had for
their protection only a squad of Americans under a sergeant,
with a Lewis gun.  The great danger in the situation lay
in the threat of the capture of the rear village by an attack
from the close-edging forest.  If this lower position was
taken, the garrison would be trapped, starved and cut off
from all communication with Bereznik and Archangel.
Customarily, there were kept on hand rations sufficient to
last from two to three weeks.
</p>

<p>
When the British Brigadier General R. G. Finlayson
inspected the Toulgas area, on 10th November, apprehension
of such a rear attack was expressed by some of the
officers, but the general could see no real menace from that
quarter, and said that it was a military impossibility for
a large body of troops to successfully execute a flank
movement through the heavy swamps of the woods.
</p>

<p>
The day following, Armistice Day, at dawn there was
a crackling of rifles in Upper Toulgas, then the crash of
guns from the river, as a great number of Bolsheviks
swarmed from the forest, deployed in perfect order, and
advancing in squad rushes, drove the little outpost back
to our main lines.  Timed, it seemed almost to the
moment, came the roar of musketry far at rear, the staccato
rattle of machine guns and dominating all the din and
tumult, the ringing Cossack <i>Hourra!  Hourra!</i>
</p>

<p>
Our surprise was complete.  Hundreds of dark figures
sprang from the woods and closed in on Lower Toulgas.
</p>

<p>
Had the Bolsheviks been Germans, they would have
immediately rushed the Canadian guns, and the story of
Toulgas would have been one of massacre.  They did rush the
guns, but not until it was too late.  The march through
the forest had been an exhausting one, and the Bolshevik
soldiers were very tired and very hungry.  A few critical
moments were spent searching the houses of the captured
village.  One of the Commanders, Melochofski, a stalwart
giant of a man, with a high, black fur hat, entered our
hospital billet, and flourishing his arms, gave a loud-voiced
order to kill the invalided soldiers.  The British medical
N.C.O., with rare tact and extraordinary presence of mind,
placed rations and two jugs of rum before the big Bolshevik
leader, who helped himself liberally to the spirits
and under their benign influence momentarily forgot about
the execution.
</p>

<p>
Probably in this way and in ransacking Lower Toulgas,
not over three minutes were lost, but never were three
minutes more costly, for during that time the Canadians swung
round their guns, and, when the Russians rallied to renew
the attack, they were met by muzzle bursts.
</p>

<p>
Nearly a hundred years before, at Wilma, the iron
veterans of the Grand Army had been shaken by that blood
chilling <i>Hourra! Hourra!</i> of charging Russians; but now
it only made those leather faced men at the guns laugh
with the wild, delirious delight that comes only to the born
fighting man, then only when the fight is at its height.
They swore fine, full chested, Canadian blasphemies that
were a glory to hear, crammed shrapnel into their guns,
and turned terrible blasts into the incoming masses that
exploded among them and shattered them into ghastly
dismembered corpses and hurled blood and human flesh
wide in the air in sickening, splattering atoms.  While all
the time the American sergeant and his single squad kept
up an incessant fire with his Lewis automatic, and those
Canadians who were not hit, and were not needed at the
guns, worked the bolts of their rifles with the energy of
fiends, so that the crackling of small arms sounded like the
bursts of machine gun fire from the emplacements, and
deceived the Bolsheviks, who thought it was the fire of
machine guns.  These Canadians had used the rifle often
in the untracked places of the Western World, were well
schooled in marksmanship, and now when the target loomed
big and at extremely short range, they covered the ground
with dead.
</p>

<p>
The mere weight of those approaching great numbers
would have shaken and turned ordinary troops, for the
onslaught was not stopped until less than fifty yards from
the guns; but the Canadians were not ordinary men and
they gave not the slightest hope of being turned.  They
would have stood by with their bayonets to the last, and
when the Bolsheviks saw the unyielding determination of
these Western savages, to whom fear seemed unborn, and
knew that more devastating death storms of shrapnel
awaited further advance, their morale broke down, the
front wave hesitated, panic spread with telepathic swiftness,
and in the control of overpowering fear, the whole
force bolted and scampered like rabbits to the covering trees.
There they were rounded together by the remaining
commissars, and from places of concealment directed a hot fire
on the guns.
</p>

<p>
So quickly were they reorganized that fifteen minutes
after the assault had been turned back, the Company of
Royal Scots, hurrying across an open field to the support,
were subjected to such a blighting fire that the ground was
strewn with the huddled figures of their dead and wounded.
</p>

<p>
As the day advanced the chief commander of the Bolsheviks
was killed and three other commissars were picked
off and killed.  The march through the marshy forests had
been made at tremendous toll in vitality, the advantage of
surprise had now passed, rations were running low, and,
unless the attack could be pressed with renewed forces, there
would be another bivouac in the wet and cold, for the
Canadian devils watched Lower Toulgas, and, at the first sign
of occupancy, hammered and pounded and shook the houses
with high explosive until they were untenable utterly.
During the afternoon an American force from the center
village pushed back a band of riflemen that hung at the fringe
of the woods, and, as evening fell, the enemy fire grew
less sustained and it was evident that unless reinforcements
arrived, the attack would fail.  But hours passed and no
reinforcements.  The rifle reports sounded more and more
erratic, and, as the night wore on, there was only the
sporadic crack of a few snipers in the rear woods, who
held on hopefully waiting for the supports that never came.
</p>

<p>
Prisoners said there were six hundred and fifty in this
rear attack and an equal number had taken the upper
village, where they kept up a steady volley fire, but seemed
to wait upon success of the rear party before storming our
fortifications.  Therefore, far forward in the blackness of
the night, the Canadians sent forth two salvos, to let this
frontal attacking force know that the guns were intact and
that a fight was waiting beside them.
</p>

<p>
So ended the first day of the battle of Armistice Day.
There was firing all through the night from Upper
Toulgas, and luminous flares burst startlingly from unexpected
places in the blackness, but after the failure of the rear
movement, no further sustained and determined attack was
attempted.
</p>

<p>
When a patrol from the garrison entered Lower Toulgas
the next morning, men nerved themselves for a fearful
grewsome spectacle in the hospital billet; but lo, their
comrades were unharmed, and a woman in the uniform of a
Bolshevik soldier was caring for them as well as the enemy
wounded.  She had come with her sweetheart, Melochofski,
the thirty miles from Seltzo&mdash;Lady Olga, as the soldiers
called her&mdash;and had bivouacked the two cold nights with
the soldiers in the woods and swamps.  She saved the lives
of our injured men by pleading with Melochofski.  Later
she ministered to him as he died in the same hospital room
where he would have witnessed his helpless enemies die.
</p>

<p>
She was a member of the Battalion of Death, this extraordinary
woman, of intelligent, almost beautiful appearance.
Madame Botchkoreva also had been a member of the
Battalion of Death, so named because it chose to die rather
than betray Holy Russia.  Madame Botchkoreva, who had
come with the American soldiers on the transports from
America, and had spoken to them on shipboard so eloquently
and so movingly of her country and its sacred, unshakable
loyalty to the Allied cause, was said to have interceded with
President Wilson, urged the sending of American troops to
succor afflicted Russia, and prevailed upon the President.
</p>

<p>
American soldiers had already witnessed grotesque
inconsistencies in this strange campaign.  After the first fight
they picked up shell fragments with the letters "U.S.A.,"
and learned that all, or nearly all, the Bolshevik ammunition
was manufactured in their own country.  They were
told that they had been commissioned to safeguard
valuable war supplies, and, coming to Archangel, had seen the
great warehouses there destitute of those supplies.  Now
they were mystified by Lady Olga, who fought against
Madame Botchkoreva in this baffling Russian war.  Who
was the greater patriot?  Each a soldier in the uniform of
her country, each had plighted her heart to beloved Russia,
each had taken solemn oath to defend her country until
death; and both now thought they were offering their lives
for the defense of that country!
</p>

<p>
In this rear attack, one hundred Soviets were killed,
many more wounded, many taken prisoners, a few rejoined
their comrades at Upper Toulgas, and the rest faded in
the forest and were lost.  Weeks afterwards, the villagers
at Nitzni Kitsa, fifty miles to the west, told of three
Bolshevik soldiers who came to their village in a crazed
condition, clad in rags, and half starved, babbling an incoherent
story of the frightful battle of Toulgas on Armistice Day,
and of hundreds of their comrades, lost in the woods and
perishing in the treacherous quagmire of the swamps.
</p>

<p>
Following Armistice Day, early the next morning there
was a flash at the bend of the river beyond Upper Toulgas,
then the screaming passage of a shell, and the dull,
vibrating, smashing roar of high explosive as it struck near the
bridge.  Two enemy gunboats were seen mounted with three
inch and six inch guns.  Further up the river and beyond
sight was still another craft with six inch guns.  Concealed
among the trees, just on the edge of the clearing before
Upper Toulgas, was a complete Bolshevik Field Battery,
and these combined cannon now concentrated on the
blockhouse that guarded the bridge.  Shells, tossing geysers of
dirt and debris, struck all around, and ploughed a deep
circular furrow within a radius of five yards of the death
house, where seven Americans sat with blanched faces and
set teeth, counting the seconds between the hideous
successive whine of the plunging shells, and waiting silently
for certain destruction.  At the edge of Upper Toulgas,
Bolshevik infantry stood crouched for the dash, watching
for the strongpoint to collapse under the terrific pommeling
bombardment.
</p>

<p>
A stack of hay was near the important post, where a
shell smashed, scattered the hay to right and left, and
clogged the loophole that outlooked to the enemy position.
The American sergeant in command sprang from the
blockhouse, snatched the obscuring hay, and was back again,
while bullets from the amazed Bolsheviks spurted inches
over his head.
</p>

<p>
Again the same thing happened, and again the sergeant,
Floyd A. Wallace, with as noble an exhibition of cool,
deliberate courage as man is capable, went out to clear the
covered loophole, and did clear it, but he crawled back with
a hole in his tunic from a machine gun, and his drab coat
was soaked deep red from a grievous wound.
</p>

<p>
It was noon when the blockhouse was hit.  It crumpled
like paper under the impact, and one man, drenched with
a welter of blood, was seen to drag himself from the
wreckage and crawl back to the priest's house.  I saw this man
on the deck of the transport when the Americans were
leaving Archangel in June, every soldier radiant at the
prospect of farewell to the army and Russia, and going home,
but he had not yet learned to smile, and written on his
face and deep in his eyes was the look of one who has gazed
at hell.
</p>

<p>
When the bridge post was knocked out, one American,
carrying a reserved Lewis gun, followed by two more each
with panniers of ammunition, rushed from the house back
of the church, and the three, dashing a few yards at a time,
then throwing themselves flat on their faces, made the
cover of a trench by the side of the priest's house, and,
when the Bolsheviks came forward to the bridge, scattered
them with a heavy fire.
</p>

<p>
In the emergency, a Vickers gun was hastily barricaded
against a church window that looked down on the bridge.
A platoon had come down the hill from the center village
when it was seen that the blockhouse could not survive, and,
using the skirmish tactics of the Indian, had passed through
a tempest of rifle and machine gun bullets to the billet house,
and reached the church.  These were only a few instances of
brilliant initiative.  Nowhere than at Toulgas during the
battle of Armistice Day was there better truth of that
French saying during the war: "Every American private
soldier is an officer."
</p>

<p>
Several times the Bolsheviks felt out the bridge, and the
commissars in rear could be heard urging their men to the
attack, but each time they drew back before the heavy, well
directed fire of the Americans, and, although the artillery
smashed the white church and made of the priest's house a
rent and tattered ruin, the defense held at every point till
with merciful darkness the gunboats ceased their cursed
belching, the guns in the forward woods subsided to blessed
silence, and, screened by the shielding night, the Americans
were able to bring in their wounded and send relief to those
who had stood at the most exposed posts without rations or
water for many long hours.
</p>

<p>
On the third day of battle, the Bolshevik batteries were
augmented by two six inch guns brought down river from
Seltzo to Andreevskaya, and all guns as throughout the first
two days stayed safely beyond the furthermost range of our
feeble three inch pieces.  Despairing of breaking down the
obstinate defense of the bridge, the bombardment shifted to
our fortifications on the forest flank of the center village,
and here for hours high explosive projectiles and clouds of
shrapnel fell at the rate of one shell every fifteen seconds,
ranging from the strongpoints that guarded attack from the
direction of the woods, to a row of huts on the side hill close
by, where a platoon was quartered as a reserve for these
outposts.
</p>

<p>
Hardly had the Americans withdrawn from one of these
huts, when its roof was smashed with deafening explosion,
and then bolts struck right and left with stunning rapidity
like raging messages from hell, flinging debris and dirt and
fragments of wood in wild disorder that fell down upon the
prostrate men crouching in a nearby fold of ground.  The
houses on the hill were raked through and through and many
became a chaos of splintered timbers; the air was stabbed
by the sibilant, vindictive snarl of the shells, fluttered and
throbbed with their violent passage, the ground trembled
in quaking travail; shrapnel burst in gray clouds, fell
rattling on the house roofs or plumped down to the wet ground
with suggestive vicious thuds, and the cumulative effect of
successive thunderclap detonations was like a physical
pommeling on the brain.
</p>

<p>
But through it all the Americans held fast, clinging to
sanity by sheer point of a desperate wilfulness and facing
the Bolshevik infantry men with unwavering front, so that
they dared not show themselves and were still back in the
forest when night came to heal the hideous turmoil of the
day and still the shaking salvos that stormed through every
hour of light, and would be renewed at first dawn, for the
Bolsheviks never relented in their determination to take the
village Toulgas.
</p>

<p>
The great Trotsky himself directed the attack.  Prisoners
said that, stationed like Napoleon on one of the river craft,
he watched the battle from afar.  The Soviet leader made
an address to his soldiers and told them that he intended
to keep hammering at Toulgas if it took all winter to break
down resistance of the garrison.  The battle was fought on
the first birthday anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution,
and its objective was to sweep through the Allies' lines to
Bereznik, where the soldiers were promised many gifts from
the valuable stores there.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of this third day we took an appraisal of
our fast failing resources and estimated the prospect of a
further stand.  If the attack had settled to a siege, it looked
as if there was small hope ahead, for a quarter of the little
company had been hit, and those who remained were hollow-eyed
from fatigue, so weary that they staggered like
drunken men.  All night long, enemy patrols prowled about
the defenses, sounding them for a weak point, rifles cracked
and snapped and through the black sleepless hours, machine
guns beat the devil's own tattoo.
</p>

<p>
There was a tacit understanding in the way each man
eyed his mate that when the fortifications fell there would
be a street fight in the center village and the Bolsheviks
would take no prisoners.  These men from Michigan and
Wisconsin had come from Camp Custer, and, when the
trial came, Custer's spirit would triumph over flesh and
live again the glory of the Little Big Horn.  Likewise in
those fighting ranks were heirs of Cromwell's men and a
host of sires whose imperishable battle deeds have risen to
the heights of gods the strength of mother England's
fighting men.  So there was no thought of surrendering Toulgas,
and evacuation was entirely out of the question.  If the
Bolsheviks were bent upon a determined siege, they could
bring fresh levies of men and new guns from their Dvina
Headquarters at Krasnoborsk, a short distance from Seltzo;
but Toulgas had no new guns to draw upon, and there were
no supports and no reserves for Toulgas.
</p>

<p>
Our Command decided that the only hope lay in a bold
counterstroke.  The Scots relieved the Americans at the
outposts, and in the murk of early morning, on the fourth day
of battle, the American company crept through the noiseless
forest and surrounded an observation post in the woods
on the flank off Upper Toulgas.  Several Bolsheviks were
killed and the rest fled to the enemy village in panic, with
the report of a great force which had overwhelmed them.
The observation post with many rounds of small arms
ammunition was set afire, the explosions sounded like the
musketry of a regiment, and the tired and discouraged
Bolsheviks thought it was a fresh regiment firing unseen from
the unknown depths of the forest.
</p>

<p>
Fortune plays a great part in war, and uncertainty
accounts for many things that appear inexplicable reviewed
from the comfortable distance of peace; perhaps the most
important information that can come to a commanding
officer is knowledge of enemy strength and his fighting
morale, and the Bolsheviks had no such information.  They
had lost their Chief Commander Foukes in this forest
counter-attack, and a message from him, found on the body
of a runner who was trying to reach Upper Toulgas, read:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We are in the lowest village.  One steamer coming up
river&mdash;perhaps reinforcements.  Attack more vigorously.
Melochofski and Murafski are killed.  If you do not attack
I cannot hold on, and retreat is impossible,
11th November, 1918.  12:30 P.M.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
FOUKES.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
With Foukes, four of the five commissars had been killed,
and now when the frightened survivors of the detached
outpost spread the alarm of overwhelming numbers of Americanskis
in the forest, the Bolsheviks were seen fleeing Upper
Toulgas in skeltering disorder.
</p>

<p>
The Americans dared not pursue, for to do so would have
revealed their true strength, and they were outnumbered
four to one.  Besides, they were too elated at being rid of
the enemy to give him the chance to return to the attack.
They contented themselves with taking prisoner those
stragglers who could not keep pace with the leaderless rabble
that dispersed into the forest.
</p>

<p>
A row of houses isolated near the stream at the edge of
Upper Toulgas was suspected of being the dwelling place
of unfriendly peasants.  The Bolsheviks used these houses
as vantage points for sharpshooters, and in the counter
combat a number of prisoners were taken from them, so now,
when we gained the upper hand, "sniper's row" of huts
was condemned, the peasants were cast out with their scanty
possessions, and as the first snow filled the air and spread
an apron over the drab colored ground, the homes of their
fathers became a sea of crackling flames, and the poor
moujiks, women and children sobbing hysterically, and men
with mute sadness and uncomprehending resignation on
their bearded faces, set forth to begin life anew.
</p>

<p>
The prisoners taken in this battle of Armistice Day, all
except one, expressed no martyr's devotion to the cause of
the Soviets.  Some spoke of being impressed in the Red
army at the point of the bayonet, and being kept in the
ranks by the same argument.  Others said that they had
joined to escape starvation, and there appeared to be
something plausible in this assertion for as far as we had gone
into the interior the people of the Archangel villages were in
desperate want.  The Bolsheviks had commandeered all
available food supplies which at best were not bountiful,
barely sufficient to sustain the life of the villages through
the long cold winter; a few potatoes with a little wheat
which the peasants had cached in forest dugouts sustained
life in some manner.  Later had not the Allies doled out
rations of flour and other food stuffs from Archangel, many
in the Province would have perished of slow starvation
during that winter of 1919.
</p>

<p>
The ration of the Bolshevik army was ample enough; a
portion that looked princely to the moujik: a <i>funt</i> (fourteen
ounces) of meat, one and three-quarters <i>funts</i> of bread,
with tea, sugar and tobacco for every soldier.
</p>

<p>
If the stories of the prisoners were true and not inspired
by motives of gaining sympathy, one could believe those
Russians of the <i>intelligencia</i> who asserted that the Bolshevik
party was a minority party of terrorism, and that very few
Russians were ardent Soviets.
</p>

<p>
Even Lenine himself, once said that of every one hundred
Bolsheviks fifty were knaves, forty fools, and probably
only one a sincere follower.
</p>

<p>
Two highly cultivated artillery officers, who had held
commissions in the Imperial Army, gave themselves up
shortly after the battle of Armistice Day and told a tale of
being forced into the Bolshevik army by the threat to kill
their families if they refused.  They said that all Bolshevik
officers were ceaselessly observed by spies who were quick
to report to Staff Headquarters the slightest symptom of a
wayward disposition, or the suspicion of any gesture of
mutiny.
</p>

<p>
Few of the prisoners wore any regulation military
uniforms.  In appearance there was nothing, except the
carrying of firearms, to distinguish them from the moujiks of
the villages.  Both were clad in like <i>valenkas</i>, or felt boots,
dirty, gray, curled, high fur hats, shapeless dun-colored
tunics.  Many of the villagers were in sympathy with the
Soviets, and despite all vigilance, there was an active system
of espionage between many moujiks and the Bolshevik
leaders with which it was impossible to cope.  Our
Intelligence received information that the rear attacking party
had been conducted to our lines by a prominent resident of
Toulgas, and sometimes the enemy showed amazing knowledge
of our forces and the state of our fortifications that
must have come from those in whose houses we dwelt as
unwelcome guests.
</p>

<p>
There was but brief respite after the four days' battle of
Armistice Day, for the American engineers set all hands
vigorously to work on the winter defenses.  Around the
center village, blockhouses were built on the forest flank,
and at front and rear at points distanced from two to three
hundred yards one from the other.  Coils of barbed wire
were transported over the snow from Bereznik and strung
in wire aprons between the strong points.  Every
blockhouse had an automatic rifle or a machine gun, and some
at the more important posts had two, all targeted and
trained to lay down a devastating, enfilade fire along the
connecting wire barriers.  A few Colt machine guns that
were air cooled arrived, and helped the morale immensely,
for they had no difficulty functioning in the very low
temperatures.  Then, when there was more time, the
blockhouses were reconstructed with heavy timbers and piled
high with sand so that they became bomb proof to anything
except the explosion of a six inch shell, and even along the
unfeared river bank there were placed two small blockhouses
with machine guns.
</p>

<p>
When the snow mounted high and icy winds stung with
the sting of wasps, Toulgas had become a fortress, well
nigh impregnable, unless her defenses were penetrated from
within, or the attack came in hopelessly overpowering numbers.
</p>

<p>
But scarce had all this preparation commenced, when
came glorious news of the Armistice.  The war was ended,
and it was taken as a matter of course that the coming peace
would extend to the war of the Arctic Circle.
</p>

<p>
From the outset the soldiers never had any rampant
enthusiasm in this strange conflict with its motives of
mystery, but while the struggle in France went on they
stilled their questioning doubts and followed the work set
out for them by their officers in the uncertain belief that
somewhere back of the scenes at Paris or London or
Washington those in the high places had charted a wise policy
beyond the comprehension of a common soldier; and that
in some devious, undisclosed way the campaign in Russia
was necessary, was playing its inexplicable part in completing
the defeat of the Germans.  Even when weeks elapsed
and no announcement of change in policy was forthcoming,
the men were patient and did not complain.  But when at
the end of November, Consul General Poole sent word from
Archangel that the Americans in North Russia would continue
at their tasks to the end, knowledge came to the soldier
with stunning reality that the great struggle in which he was
prepared to die had no relation to the war with Russia, in
which he probably would die, that he was engaged in a war
which had no assignable reason for its being, in which many
of his companions had already been killed, and the end was
not in sight.
</p>

<p>
The uncertainty, the isolation of the distant snowbound
fronts, the ever present prospect of being trapped by enemy
occupation of the villages along the extended communication
line, and now that the excitement of the fight had
waned, the depressing monotony of the days ground down
the spirit of the men.  They commenced to lose heart.  Life
became a very stale, flat, drab thing in the vast stretches
of cheerless snow reaching far across the river to the murky,
brooding skies and the encompassing sheeted forests, so
ghostly and so still, where death prowled in the shadows
and the sinking realization came home of no supports or
reserves along the two hundred miles of winding winter road
to Archangel.
</p>

<p>
Week follows week, and November goes by, and December,
and no word comes from the War Department.  No
reassuring message to the perplexed Commander-in-Chief,
defining the purposes of the war, its duration, when relief
will come.  No word comes and the soldier is left to think
that he has been abandoned by his country and left to rot
on the barren snow wastes of Arctic Russia.
</p>

<p>
Men move about wintered Toulgas emitting great clouds
of vapored breath, shuffling over the snow in the clumsy
Shakleton Arctic boots, wrapped in great coats against the
bitter, deadly cold; on their faces the condemned look of
felons from whom all hope has fled.
</p>

<p>
In the dismal huts of the village soldiers are packed with
the crowded moujik families like herded animals, where the
atmosphere is dank and pestilent with an odor like stale
fish.  Filth is on the floor and vermin creep from the cracks
and crevices of the log walls.
</p>

<p>
In December and January there are only a few hours of
feeble shadowing light, then tragic blackness blots out the
snows and the mournful woods and the skies of melodrama.
With night the tiny windows are shrouded with board
coverings, a candle flickers in the low ceiling room, unless
the issue is exhausted, then a bully beef can is produced,
filled with bacon grease and an improvised rag wick which
flutters a hesitant glimmering through the heavy gloom.
</p>

<p>
There through the long dark unwholesome hours, the
Americans sit and think thoughts more black than the outside
night.  Red, hateful, revolutionary thoughts like those
of the maddened mob that rushed Louis Seize to the
guillotine, and that would threaten the stability of any nation.
Black thoughts of their country and the smug, pompous
statesmen who with sonorous patriotic phrases had sent
them to exile; of the casual people at home and their
damned complacency and their outlook on war as a
gorgeous heraldry of youth, a gay, romantic adventure.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it almost seemed as if malignant Bolshevism
had poisoned the air, for once in February when the situation
looked worst and nothing seemed certain except annihilation
for the whole garrison, the American soldiers at Toulgas
threatened, unless promised early relief, to walk out like
disgruntled factory hands.  The same thing, but with a more
serious aspect, occurred in an American company at
Archangel; and the French on the Railway had, at first rumor
of the Armistice, flatly deserted and returned to Archangel.
At Kodish a company of British refused to fight further in
this indefinite war, and among the first conscripted Russian
troops there was serious mutiny resulting in much bloodshed.
</p>

<p>
But there was nothing mutinous in this expression of
opinion at Toulgas.  It seemed the only course to civilian
soldiers who were schooled in strikes under an industrial
system where the strike has always been the concerted
expression of disapproval by those who toil in the ranks.
When the nature of a mutiny was explained to these men,
they felt a burning shame for what they had done so
unwilfully, and never again, throughout the many discouraging,
hopeless days that followed, was there the smallest hint
of protest from these civilian American soldiers.
</p>

<p>
When the days were shortest, the commissary transport
broke down, and for a time the principal ration was corned
beef that was frozen in the tin, and a nauseating mixture
of vegetables and stewed meat that had been alternately
frozen and thawed in the tin, and when eaten, gave some
loathsome skin diseases and others dysentery.
</p>

<p>
Cooking and eating were the only breaks in the
melancholy monotony; there was no diversion, no relaxation, no
recreation, and the divine gift of humor which was the
salvation of the Western soldier, was denied to the soldier
of North Russia, for humor springs from buoyant spirits,
the wells of radiant health, and the Americans on the Dvina
were so physically depleted that in February the medical
officer of the First Battalion reported that one-third of all
those on active duty should be committed to the hospital
without delay.  But these sickened soldiers could not be
sent to the hospital without abandoning the undermanned
posts that guarded the garrison.
</p>

<p>
Robbed of physical resistance and broken in spirit it
was pitiful to see strong men and brave men become shrinking
cowards, filled with a vague, sapping dread, under the
uninterrupted strain and the depressing influence of the long
nights.  Fidgety sentinels were constantly seeing lurking
Bolsheviks conjured by their morbid imagination from the
menacing shadows of the woods, and there was an epidemic
of accidental self-inflicted wounds, which always occurred
at the ticklish, unsupported, advanced positions.
</p>

<p>
The doctors pronounced many as cases of neurasthenia
induced by much loss of sleep, unbroken fatigue, and
continual drain upon the nervous forces.  They looked solemn
and dubious and said it was demanding too much of human
endurance to expect the defense to hold on without relief
through the many winter days that stretched ahead.
</p>

<p>
One January night, terrible in the severity of its cold,
all hands "stood to" and waited for the rush from the
woods, for sentinels had heard the muttering of many voices
and had caught the movement of bodies among the trees;
but no attack developed, and in the morning the tracks of
timber wolves were found approaching almost to our wire,
where the pack had stopped to sniff the scent from these
strange tenanted loghouses, standing apart on the snow, like
outcasts of the village.
</p>

<p>
The few sentinels kept far in advance at the front village
were always having jumping nerves, and robbing exhausted
men of precious sleep; but once in truth they were nearly
surrounded during the night and escaped by a miracle.  So
it was decided to burn the houses, as "sniper's row" had
been burned in November.  Some two hundred peasants
were turned out in the snow, and Upper Toulgas became a
dirty smudge on the whitened plain over which our range
of visibility extended far to the forward woods, and our
field of fire was increased comfortingly.
</p>

<p>
The High Command passed out word that Arctic conditions
would preclude any active fighting, but the prisoners
spoke differently.  They said that the Bolshevik Staff expected
the Allied soldiers to die like flies in the cold winter,
that the enemy intended to strike when the cold was most
bitter, the snow deepest, and so they did.
</p>

<p>
In January, with a temperature forty degrees below zero
Fahrenheit, at midnight, Bolshevik batteries from across
the Dvina commenced shelling Toulgas, and continued for
fifteen minutes a bombardment that went wild in the dark
and struck harmlessly far from our works.
</p>

<p>
Directly the last shell had been fired, enemy infantry
advanced in the open and rushed our front posts.  In the
darkness there was frantic, wild fighting and struggling in
the deep snow, shrill yells and a confused babble in a
foreign language, the hideous moans of the wounded, the
ringing commands of the commissars in rear, urging their men
forward to sure death, and the prolonged explosions of
machine guns spurting a rain of bullets over the heads of the
attackers to warn them of a death that waited in rear if
they turned back.
</p>

<p>
In two hours the force of the assault was spent, the last
shot had been fired, and the snow before one of the blockhouses,
where enfilading fire had cut up the attack, was covered
with Bolshevik bodies.  The fight was an uneven one,
for the Americans in the blockhouses fired from bullet proof
cover and were sheltered from the weather; but the
Bolsheviks had to advance against barbed wire, struggle in the
snow against targeted machine guns and had no protection
from paralyzing cold.  Many of the prisoners were so badly
frostbitten that arms and feet were amputated to save their
lives.
</p>

<p>
In February, acting in cooperation with the enemy
offensive on the Vaga, a large force of fresh troops composed
mainly of the Eighty-second Tarasovo regiment, who knew
nothing of the reputation of Toulgas and the fate of other
attacking parties, waded through the cold snow forests, clad
in white smocks to blend with the color of the ground,
floundered up to our lines in the impenetrable night, and
were not discovered until they were engaged in cutting
the wire between two blockhouses.  They were fairly
trapped then between the enfilading fire of two sets of
machine guns and suffered fearful carnage before they fought
their bloody way back wading ponderously through the deep
snow to the forest.
</p>

<p>
Some of the dead came abruptly to life and gave
themselves up when a search was made of the bodies next
morning; horribly frozen by exposure, they said they preferred
an uncertain chance of life at the hands of the Englishskis
and Americanskis, to the certain chance of death in a further
attempt to conquer Toulgas.
</p>

<p>
After this sanguinary fight, the Bolshevik soldiers met in
a great assemblage, made bitter speeches against the
Commander who had led them to disaster, and resolutions were
passed which threatened death to any commissar who insisted
on another assault of Toulgas and the fighting fiends
who defended it.
</p>

<p>
So this village, far up the Dvina, was no longer the prey
for wild midnight sorties and desperate melodramatic
clashes in the deep snow, and there might have been
comparative peace for the garrison were it not for adherence to
those cardinal precepts of military orthodoxy that aggressive
contact with the enemy must be always maintained and
reconnaissance is vital to a successful combat campaign.  It
was to conform to these inflexible precepts of the military
that patrols left Toulgas seeking for Bolsheviks.
Sometimes they went forth on webfooted snow-shoes, and
scouted the forest far on the threatening flank to discover
whether the enemy had found some new method to approach
our positions, and then they served a useful purpose.  But
the customary patrol party was the one that went out every
day, a band of three or four, along a trail of padded snow
just wide enough for a single file, that led through the front
forest, five miles to the nearest enemy position at Zastrovia.
</p>

<p>
A hunter can understand this tracked snow trail.  It was
like a game runway that leads to a salt lick, fresh signs
show that deer pass every day, and it is only a question of
time until the hunter gets his chance for the fatal shot.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, by the mere coincidence of fate, a patrol
would turn about in the trail and start back towards friendly
lines, when a machine gun would snap and crack and a rush
of bullets sing harmlessly high, where another hundred
yards meant death from the ambuscade; and often the scouts
would come to the hidden waiting spot where imprints in
the snow left the story of a large Bolshevik force that had
stayed long, but, overcome by the cold, had been forced to
quit the death hunt.
</p>

<p>
Often the Bolsheviks would leave bundles of propaganda
on these patrol paths, much of it written in English,
inciting British and American soldiers to mutiny, to kill their
officers and join the Soviets in a revolution for the world
wide supremacy of the proletariat.
</p>

<p>
Death walked these white runways.  Death, and his
romantic partner, Chance.  But the color of youth had
vanished before dour, wan reality with the soldier of North
Russia, and the romance of Chance was lost on him.  Yet
it was strange how often men could walk these suicidal
paths and escape unscathed.  The goddess was kind, she
visited them with benevolent mood, save a few times such as
once in March, when from a party of seven, only one got
back to tell of the fatal ambush.
</p>

<p>
When a platoon hurries out to pick up some sign of the
others, it is caught in the open at Upper Toulgas, pocketed
from the supporting fire of our own lines.  There in the
open snow, and denied all cover, the men are trapped like
condemned animals.  They flatten on the snow and fire at
an unseen foe that pelts a withering fire from behind trees
three hundred yards on a quartering forward flank; bullets
whip the snow beside them and sweep by in such a storm
that the air whimpers and cries aloud like a tortured
living thing.  At the end of three hours snow clogging in rifle
breeches has frozen solid and they can shoot no more.
Then, when it looks as if all were lost, the last man on the
line gets back to the artillery, but is so winded and funked
by his experience that his directions are a confused babble
and the artillery opens up at risk of hitting our own men,
shrapnel bursts in front of the platoon, the murdering fire
from the clump of trees slackens, and the officer is able to
withdraw his men to a God-given dip in the ground, all
that are left of them, for out on the white snow still stretches
a crumpled drab colored line; some lie very still, others
writhe in the agony of grievous or fatal wounds.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Two days after this shambles of the snows, an officer and
three men were met, on the forest runway to Zastrovia, by
the fire of a large force of Bolsheviks, but until the day the
Americans left Toulgas, there was no abatement of the
perilous policy of patrols in this undefined war, where the
loss of every life seemed sacrilegious sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
And this amazing campaign so prodigal of men's lives
continued through the lengthening winter days.
</p>

<p>
At the end of March the sun had mounted high, and
the snows were fields of myriad dazzling diamonds.  A
new fresh fragrance filled the air, and brought the promise
of vague, perceptible hope.  Spring was coming with the
sun, and the renewal of youth would not be denied.
</p>

<p>
Then the Headquarters of the American Expeditionary
Force took cognizance of the war with Russia and sent a
general officer to command the forces from Archangel.
</p>

<p>
Then the Secretary of War announced that no more
troops would be sent, and the units there withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
This was the end, but the Americans did not know it.
The Royal Scots came to take over the defenses, the old
Category Bs, with their wound stripes, their traditional,
cockney jauntiness and just a hint of superiority in their
eyes for the Yanks who were leaving the show.
</p>

<p>
It was strange how that night the winter's harshness
relented in the gentle lulling wind, and in the luminous spell
of the limpid moon, weary, war-worn Toulgas was at peace,
sleeping, in unbroken white stillness.
</p>

<p>
Far up the sloping hill the rude silhouette of the center
village is etched against a starlighted sky.  Forward the
church, shell gashed and mutilated, with its grotesque
minarets, and the moon, a pendulous globe of living fire.  Clear
in the lucid light is the hard contested bridge, that means
so little and yet so much; beyond, the charred ruins of the
sacrificed village, and, still farther, the somber, gloomy
forest.  Vividly white gleams the church beneath the steely
mystic moon, but whiter than the church or moon are the
endless wastes of immaculate, unmarred snows that reach
across the great river to the lurking darkness of the distant
shore and abroad to the sinister shadows of crested trees.
</p>

<p>
This is Russia of the American soldier&mdash;a cluster of
dirty huts, dominated by the severe white church, and,
encircling all, fields and fields of spotless snows; Russia,
terrible in the grasp of devastating Arctic cold; the squalor
and fulsome filth of the villages; the moujik, his mild
eyes, his patient bearded face&mdash;the gray drudgery and
gaping ignorance of his starved life; the little shaggy pony,
docile and uncomplaining in winds, icy as the breath of the
sepulcher; Russia, her dread mystery, and that intangible
quality of melodrama that throngs the air, and lingers
in the air, persistently haunts the spirit, and is as
consciously perceptible as the dirty villages, the white church,
and the grief-laden skies.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was not until nearly June the Americans were told
that their bizarre service to their country was at an end.
They were to go by slow stages back through the Dvina
villages, always within call in case of dire need.  But at
last the purple day comes, and they are going home.  A
troop ship off among the ice floes of the White Sea toils
westward, and upon its decks is a throng of soldiers who
gaze with equivocal valediction upon the failing Russian
coast, which mingles imperceptibly with the distant haze,
and so passes like this shameful war to the bourne of
memory's empire.  The fairy rumor has come true, the
Americans are going home.

<p class="intro">
"In North Russia, Shenkurst has been abandoned

country is apt to hear much of these American battalions
of North Russia, whether they live or die.  If they

THE VAGA
</p>

<p>
The meagre numbers of the Railway had been irreparably
spent by the establishment of the Onega force,
on the west, and a like outguard at Seletskoe on the east,
with its right and left wings, Kodish and Shred Mekrenga.
</p>

<p>
Now, as it followed up the Dvina, in the same manner,
the dubious, striking power of the River Column was lost
by the output along the tenuous, weaving waterway of
many communicating posts, that like great drops of heart
blood from a mortal hurt, wasted its vitality and drained
its strength, until it could go no further.
</p>

<p>
These posts, like Indian blockhouses of frontier days,
were strung along the river course nearly to far Archangel,
and in them, insignificant detachments, with the grim, quiet
resolution of the frontier men, and the steady, reliant nerve
of the frontier men, safeguarded the backward way, where
always silent, winter darkness held ceaseless, dire, ominous
threats.
</p>

<p>
In the Shred Mekrenga offensive of January, when the
enemy sought to cut off the River Column from its base, he
launched a venomous attack at one of these river posts far
back at Morjagorskaya, but the British garrison held
without flinching and saved the communications by a narrow
margin.
</p>

<p>
By this process of dispatching numerous, guarding
detachments throughout the province, the Allied forces,
utterly trivial at the outset, became so dispersed that the
"offensive war" swiftly degenerated into a disjunctive,
raiding excursion, and the invasion, instead of striking the Red
Bolos with terror and chasing them like scurrying quail to
cover, was regarded by the enemy with contempt, even
derision.  The Bolshevik soldiers, at first panicky, soon
overcame their fear, and when their leaders saw that no
reinforcements could come through the frozen north port, they
assumed an attitude of aggressive defiance, and were ever
conducting raids, ever menacing the long, basal lines, the
flanks and rear of the far separated, uncoordinated,
unsupported Allied fronts.  On the Dvina, hardly had the
detached American company taken over the defense of the
costly stores at Bereznik, when friendly natives from
Shenkurst directed the observation of our Command to the
danger of a rear flanking movement from that quarter, so
half of the garrison was detailed up the Vaga to take
possession of this city of Shenkurst in the name of "friendly
intervention."
</p>

<p>
It must be said that for the most part the city welcomed,
with a genuine, welcoming spirit, the coming of the foreign
liberators, for many people had fled north to Shenkurst
from the violent Reds at Moscow and Petrograd, who hated
the <i>intelligencia</i> and everything else that was unproletarian,
with a destructive, vehement hatred.
</p>

<p>
These people were the Russians of literature, cultivated
and mannerly in appearance, soft spoken in approach, and
accustomed to the niceties, the softer things of life.  They
wore shoes and stockings, and with a revealing hint of
gawkiness, most of the rest of our unimaginative, Western
habit; also they had a few of the simple delicacies on their
tables that seemed like fairy gifts to the homesick,
American soldiers.
</p>

<p>
The Vaga is noticeably smaller than the Dvina, and
seldom exceeds a breadth of a half mile, more often it is
five hundred yards, even less, and the soil through which
it plows a tumid trail is soft, sandy loam, so that high,
commanding bluffs have been eroded by its waters, where
the villages group in almost neighborly proximity.  On
one of these bluff heights, stood effete Shenkurst, a
generation removed from moujik poverty and enchaining
ignorance, and consciously superior to the humble log huts
that below north and south trailed the river.  The
dominating buildings, a monastery, a barracks of the Tsar, and
five conspicuous churches were white as Russia's snows,
and in the fall, made Shenkurst flaringly garish in its frame
of tenebrious, surrounding forest.
</p>

<p>
Nearly a week of tranquillity passed with the Americans
at Shenkurst, when the Staff, chafing at this prolonged
unbelligerency, issued orders "to stir up the enemy," and
some one hundred Americans, with fifty Allied Russian
soldiers, embarked to reconnoitre the upper river.
</p>

<p>
All was uneventful, until ten miles out from Shenkurst,
when suddenly an unseen fire poured from both high river
embankments on the steamer bearing the unsuspecting,
scouting party; there was no method of gauging the
ambuscade, which judged by the volume of fire, most of which
screeched harmlessly high, was far stronger than the
Americans; but on the instant, the officer beached his craft on
the nearest ground, the eager men scrambled over the side
into the water waist deep, and engaged the enemy, who
was so taken back by this unexpected action that he wilted
into the forest; then, entirely undaunted, the little party
moved on down the forest road, which wound south with
the river, and into the sinister shadows of an unexplored,
uncharted, alien country, where many signs pointed to
certain, overpowering resistance, and the law of probabilities
pointed to extinction.
</p>

<p>
The American in command, Captain Odjard, was more
an antique Viking than a city-bred modern, and as the
intrepid march continued, he never wavered in his
purpose to penetrate the heart of the Bolshevik stronghold;
for twenty days he kept on, despite distressing hardship,
and short, iron rations, and most grievous of all, the utter
absence of comforting tobacco.  Reports came constantly
that the enemy was intent upon the capture or destruction
of the little band, Bolsheviks thronged the forward way
through the forest, and every day information reached
Captain Odjard that the villages in his rear were heavily
garrisoned with enemy forces; most serious of all, the fast
vanishing ration supplies would soon be all gone.  Situations
such as this search the innermost fiber of the stuff
that makes for leadership.  There are no precedents.  A
man of courage and valiant will would face about and
fight his way back and perhaps die fighting.  A coward
would vacillate and falter in a mortal terror of indecision,
and thus perish.
</p>

<br />
The only means of transportation after the rivers were closed
</p>

<p>
Stonewall Jackson and Forrest would do the genius born,
unexpected thing.  The Viking pressed onward, met the
hostile Russians, forced them to a savage engagement, in
which they lost in killed and wounded twice the number of
the entire reconnoitering force, then turned about and
backtracked the cleared way to the south, hastily abandoned
by the Bolsheviks, in every reasonable fear of meeting the
outnumbering reinforcements that surely must be coming
up in support of such a bold and confident advance.
</p>

<p>
But at Ust Padenga, fifteen miles from Shenkurst, the
party was stopped by a dispatch from Headquarters.  It
would go no farther downstream, but would act as an
advanced outguard for the main Vaga position, a barricade
to serve as a distant, delaying obstacle, and so render the
inner post more easily defended.
</p>

<p>
For when the notion of an offensive war languished with
the General Staff, and had nearly expired, it was revived
a little by the theory of "an offensive defense," in which
the six, widely scattered, battle fronts acted as protective
tentacles, each of them in turn establishing an "offensive"
outguard for Archangel, since once this virus of the
"offensive defense" was inoculated in the Allied Command, it
would not rest dormant, but persisted, assertive to the
ultimate.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Nature, flagrantly disrespectful of the
military, swung the seasons in their immutable cycle.  Fall
made her parting courtesy, and winter with dread message
and icy breath waited on the threshold.
</p>

<p>
The hope was not yet dead of the Railway Column gaining
Plesetskaya, and the present objective of the Vaga force
was to penetrate some eighty miles to Velsk, an important
junction point of roads converging from the area of
Plesetskaya, from the city of Vologda and from the Dvina.
</p>

<p>
The Railway got little further than Obozerskaya, and
the little River Column, by the end of October, was at bay,
fighting for life nearly two hundred miles from Kotlas,
its first objective.
</p>

<p>
But before these forces had been halted, already the
Vaga Expedition had gone too far, thrust out nearly one
hundred miles from the Railway, and fifty miles further
south than the River party, it presented inviting
opportunity for enemy encirclement&mdash;a dangerous salient,
projected midway between the two main Columns, and nearly
three hundred miles from Archangel, by the tortuous course
of the road.
</p>

<p>
The British are a bold people and it did not seem to
weigh heavily with them that Shenkurst, the base of this
Vaga Column, was flanked by hostile villages, where vain
attempts had been made to drive out the Bolsheviks, that
the city was garrisoned by locally recruited Russians, who
had been tried and found wanting under fire, and whose
loyalty might wane when the tide of Allied fortunes ebbed
low, as soon it did.
</p>

<p>
Shenkurst must be held, and so the reconnaissance patrol,
which had eluded doom only by the splendid dash of the
men and brilliant leadership, stayed at Ust Padenga as
an advanced outpost, and the theorists of the "offensive
defense" were satisfied.
</p>

<p>
Captain Odjard took main station in a village on a
precipitous cliff, that reared high from the river, and posted
his Russian retainers in huts that clustered on the flat
bank of the Vaga, nearly midway down the long valley
that spread south to the forest.
</p>

<p>
Quartering from this second village, and much further
down the valley was a third, conspicuous on another abrupt
bluff, which when seen from the distance of the main post,
the house tops had the picturesque appearance of toy roofs,
sculptured on a pedestal.
</p>

<p>
The houses on the flat river bank stood out naked on
the snow, and in case of attack, could be supported from
the main position, for they were well within effective
shooting range; but the other, the elevated village, was nearly
a mile away, and beside it, on the west, the forest crowded
perilously near; gullies were at the base of the bluff which
made "dead ground" there, a series of natural trenches
for an attacking party.  It was a hazardous spot, the
Russians would not stay in this distant, treacherous "Death's
snare" on the heights; and they wagged their heads
lugubriously over the few Americans who persisted in holding
it.  From the steep side of Headquarters' cliff, the usual
wagon road descended, sent offshoots to the two south
villages, and trailed off to the concealment of the lower forest.
</p>

<p>
Week succeeded week in lonely Ust Padenga, where the
sad disgarnishment of this tragical, little war was seared
vivid in the living consciousness of American soldiers.  The
Armistice came, but with it no word of enlightenment, until
they were led to believe that in the general rejoicing, the
stirring movement of momentous events, no heed could
be given to the trifling performances of their fantastic,
Arctic side show, long since forgotten in France.
</p>

<p>
Yet strange, the soldiers did not grow deeply embittered,
a stoic calm came over all and they became worshippers
of the Russian philosophy, <i>nitchevoo</i>, votaries of the Fates,
burning frankincense at their shrine, praying favor, yet
unmoved by their displeasure, indifferent to their whimsical
caprice.  They became atrophied men, asking nothing of
the future and expecting nothing.  The doctors said many
were cases of neurotic disorder, and others suffered from
enteritis and scabies, and ordered rest and the hospital, but
the Staff waved the medical men brusquely aside and
sarcastically asked who was to hold off the Bolsheviks.
</p>

<p>
During November, and shortly following the Armistice,
two patrols "seeking contact," were waylaid in ambush,
and from the first, only one man came back.  The officer
of the second might have escaped, but to do so he would
have had to leave a detachment in distress, surrounded in
the forest.  He rather chose the hazard of death, and
leading the fight, he laid down his life for his friends.
</p>

<p>
During the weeks of December and January, with their
bitter cold and dismal, somber days, trees were felled about
the defenses to widen the field of fire, and long, intersecting
lanes were laid through the forest like swaths through a
standing grain field, so that the machine guns and the
automatics might hurl their spray of death at longer range,
where skulked shadowed and grisly, white forms.  When in
the dead and quiet of the night, rockets burst from
unknown quarters, flared with ghostly glare and faded in
mystery behind inky, plumose silhouettes.
</p>

<p>
In the cold and the long darkness of winter, there was
time for reflection for any one who would be so idle, on
the defenselessness of the position, the remoteness from the
base, the hordes that were massing on the road north to
Shenkurst and meant soon to make "the big push."
</p>

<p>
Our Intelligence reported that in January the Sixth
Bolshevik Army of the north numbered forty-five thousand
seven hundred, and the dribbling replenishment of our
forces that had come down the railway from open
Murmansk, had far from kept pace with attrition by sickness
and gunshot wounds.  Disregarding our Russian Allies,
we did not have six thousand men at all fronts.
</p>

<p>
By the middle of January, a blighting influence, a
devastating, nether presence filled the air, like the spell of
an evil spirit, and as capable of being finitely recorded as
the testimony of eyes and ears.  There was in the atmosphere
something closely akin to that heavy, stifling calm,
that in the summertime hangs over all, before the wind
swoops down and the first, big, pelting raindrops fall from
blackened thunder clouds, the advance guard of the drenching
storm that descends to earth in howling, unrestrained
fury.
</p>

<p>
All at lone Ust Padenga knew the storm was coming,
it was only a question of where it would strike.  On the
19th day of January, the dispositions were these: a platoon
of Americans held the village on the pedestal, fifty-four
allied Russians were in the village on the flat below, and
the main body of Americans, some two hundred strong,
two Field Pieces, one One Pounder of Russian design, one
Pom Pom and forty Russian artillerymen (who funked in
the first fight and were relieved by Canadians), were in
the backward village on the high bluff.
</p>

<p>
At dawn, for one hour, enemy batteries from across the
Vaga shelled the foremost position on the elevated ground,
then suddenly ceased firing, and like grotesque Jacks in
the Box, swarms of white-clad Bolsheviks arose by magic
from the concealment of the ravines.  A succession of long,
white lines came from the close forest, and across the open
snow of the Vaga came still more advancing, white-clothed
men.
</p>

<p>
Against such bulked masses, resistance was impossible.
Three machine guns, burst after burst, tore rending gaps
in the coming lines, but they merely welded and kept on.
</p>

<p>
When the last pannier of ammunition was gone, word
was given to blaze a path through to the rear&mdash;and double
time!  And now down the steep hillside the trapped
company charged, tumbling and fighting like maddened,
cornered animals, until they gained a foothold on the road
which stretched out bleak and coverless eight hundred yards
to the main village.  Some tried to make a run of it over
the bottomless, intervening snows, where they struggled
piteously like hobbled animals and were killed.  But in
most part, they dashed in frantic relays down the open
road, sprinting forward a score of yards, then flattening
on the ground, and so on, rushing and sprawling flat, until
the fatal course was run, while every rifle from the
abandoned village on the height, and the flanking forest and
across the Vaga spurted death, and machine guns rattled
rasping death, and bullets lashed the air with the furious
cracking of ten thousand whips, or sped fluttering through
the snow, and went off whimpering into space, or felled
men with sledgelike blows, until the doomed way was
strewn, end to end, with the prostrate forms of the fallen
ones, and a pitiful few, by some fluke of luck, had gained
the shielding hill.
</p>

<p>
Not ten minutes had been taken in that terrible dash
through that valley of Death's shadow, and of the forty-seven
who began the journey, six reached the goal of the
main village.  In the fearful sub-zero temperature, all of
the wounded would have perished by freezing, had not a
volunteer party, braving the unspeakable, barbarous Bolos
(who for some reason held their fire), gone out in the open
snow and brought them to shelter.  Fifteen were thus
accounted for, and the rest lay somewhere beyond sight,
"missing in action," that ambiguous, impersonal
expression of the War Department, so fraught with mingled
hope and dread, harrowing fear.

against any projectile save a six-inch shell
</p>

<p>
When night screened the battle scene, the Allied Russians,
upon their own inspiration, evacuated the village on
the flat, and the next day, the unwitting Bolsheviks began
the second phase of their investment of Ust Padenga.
Again the artillery, even more violently than the first day,
flung hurtling blasts at the deserted village, and late at
day, the infantry, grotesque, bobbing objects out on the
wide snow stretches, stormed the uncontested position.  It
was like rifle practice to shoot down those living targets,
glaringly open on the white snow, and they were downed
by tattering bursts of shrapnel, downed by musketry,
downed by awful devastating bursts from machine guns,
that moved them row upon row, until the last man had
passed to the cover of this village of costly folly, and the
snow was dotted with dead and wounded, which, from the
distant hill, looked grotesquely like raisins stuck in an
immense rice pudding.
</p>

<p>
On the third day, the surviving village, lying bare on
the unsheltered top of the cliff, was the target of a barrage
that searched it house to house, until many of the moujik
homes were wrecks of smashed timbers, and the trail of
human wreckage was a ghastly, unsightly thing.  The
American doctor went to death, a victim of the shells,
because he would not have his wounds bound up while a
single, private soldier was not relieved, but he lives with
Vaga men as long as life endures, a symbol of moral
grandeur and noblest self abnegation, that will ever inspire
faith in the immortal, spiritual entity of man.
</p>

<p>
It was not the Viking Captain who ordered retreat from
Ust Padenga.  Half of his little company was gone, but
he had no thought of yielding.  He would have held on
until the last dog was hung, if superior directions had not
come from Shenkurst.  He loved a fight, this antique Norseman,
loved the wild, esoteric fury of it.  Three times, his
men threw back the Bolsheviks, and caught in a contagion
of blood lust, they craved still more, maddened by battle,
they took hilarious delight in seeing "the Bolos bite the
snow banks."
</p>

<p>
They did not know that pitted against them was the
vanguard of an army that by every objective rule of
warfare should have crushed this rash, little group to utter
destruction; but if Ust Padenga did not know, all at Shenkurst
were fully alert to the gravity of the situation.  This
was the much proclaimed Bolshevik offensive, with its
object, the annihilation of the Allied North Russian
Expedition; and now as the full fury of the gigantic, impending
assault unfolded, the "offensive defensive" theory found
vindication, for at the Ust Padenga, little more than one
company had stood off a regiment of the enemy.
</p>

<p>
There seemed small hope of escape for the valiant Vaga
men who remained after the fourth night of the attack,
when an incendiary shell fell upon the village, sending
hungry, devouring flames athwart the curtain of the
Russian night, till naught was left of the moujik homes save
the gray ashes of "friendly intervention"; but in the
confusion of concentration, the assemblage of large numbers
and numerous troop movements, the retreating company
glided in darkness down the center of the frozen, white
covered Vaga, through the very midst of unsuspecting,
enemy hosts, and two nights later, reported at Headquarters
tired and half starved, the Viking leader among the
casualties with a serious wound.
</p>

<p>
In Shenkurst, the beleaguered city, in point of numbers,
the Slavic Battalion, nearly twelve hundred strong, was
the mainstay of the garrison, but on trial in a previous
attack for one of the two flanking villages, it had made
a sorry showing, and in a last stand, was estimated as of
uncertain, staying quality.  Besides these Russians, there
was one full company of American Infantry, the exhausted
half company from Ust Padenga, one section of the
Thirty-Eighth Canadian Field Artillery, four Two Point Nine
mountain pieces, and three trench mortars.
</p>

<p>
The Bolsheviks had surrounded Shenkurst in an immense,
unnumbered multitude.  They had mounted one nine inch
gun, two six inch guns, four Four Point Sevens and a
Battery of Field Artillery, and from three-quarters of the
forest commenced to batter down the buildings.
</p>

<p>
It could be only a brief time before the city would be
in ruins, but even more serious was the question of
provisions.  They were already limited, and in case of siege,
no new supply could be brought up until the breaking of
the river in May.
</p>

<p>
The Bolsheviks, confident that the garrison would try
to escape from Shenkurst, waited in great masses on the
main north road, eager for the coming slaughter; but a
native had informed the Allied Command of a secret path
through the deep, snow covered swamps, and at midnight,
along this unknown route, evacuation was silently effected.
</p>

<p>
Before the retreat, the Allied Russians were sent as a
protective screen along a flanking trail, but scarce had the
retiring movement begun, when what remained of them
came rushing back in frantic haste, that was altogether
unsoldierly, gasping an excited, incoherent story of how
two entire companies had deserted to the enemy lines and
the rest had fled in desperate fear for their lives.
</p>

<p>
Many civilians joined this bizarre, midnight march
through the snow forest and swamps, and made the retreat
a spectacle of wantonous disorder, as stoical men and
wailing women strove heavily on, bent under the torturing
weight of bundled treasures, which, under duress of fatigue,
one by one were reluctantly abandoned, leaving a pathetic
havoc of cluttering waste in the trail; and soldiers,
weakened by much fasting and sleepless battle nights, lurched in
the darkness, fell and lay in the cold snow, and had to be
struck and urged on by violent means, so grateful was any
surcease from further excruciating effort.
</p>

<p>
Late the next day, a merciful halt for the night was
made at Shaguvari, where a rear detached outpost of
Shenkurst had been maintained, and which outnumbering,
advance enemy patrols had vainly striven to dislodge.  But
the disheartening march was resumed in the morning, when
the Bolsheviks were reported collecting in force to cut off
retreat downstream.  So Shaguvari was added to the sum
of Russian villages fed to fires of the Allied cause and
became another charred ruin on the Vaga.
</p>

<p>
At villages outside of Kitsa, twenty miles further,
trenches were dug in the snow, and barricades improvised of
trees, in order that the driven troops might catch their
breath.  And on the Dvina, now only a few miles away,
new positions were taken, where the imperiled River
Column could be drawn back, and the consolidated Allied
forces stand embattled in a desperate last defense of
Bereznik, for if Bereznik fell, all knew it meant the beginning
of the siege of unfortified Archangel.
</p>

<p>
But the delaying action was prolonged beyond the most
sanguine dream of hope, and at Vistafka and Yeveevskaya,
Maximofskaya and Ignatevskaya, the neighboring villages
of Kitsa, the Americans held out, relieved in turns by
British troops, and the remaining Slavic allies, who atoned
for much by a heaven bestowed blunder that saved a
surrounded post of the Americans.
</p>

<p>
These places, with their unpronounceable Slavic names,
will be remembered always by the Vaga men, for here
during Arctic February and March days, they fought savage,
bloody fights in the mounting snowdrifts, and performed
deeds of sublime sacrifice and courage, that will never be
known save by those who were there.
</p>

<p>
They were still at Kitsa, and had not given ground,
when the first redolence of spring softened the rasping,
winter winds, and made the Bolshevik Commander draw
back his artillery in fear of being mired in the yielding
snow roads.
</p>

<p>
Not one of the Vaga men, in the innermost counsel of
his heart, had ever expected to live through that winter
onslaught, and when all with quiet courage stood ready
for the end, lo, the enemy abandoned the field where
victory awaited, and left the battle when it had been won.
This petty, strange and inexplicable war was freighted deep
with countless things of mystery, but none so beyond
understanding as the failure of the Bolshevik Command to
follow up the capture of Shenkurst.
</p>

<p>
The feeble, Allied remanent on the Vaga was reeling
from the stunning blows of the massed attack, and thought
of resistance all hung on the hope of saving Archangel
and the life of the Expedition; but when all tensed themselves
for the crucial shock, it did not come, the Bolshevik
advance weakened and faltered and held back, so that the
defenders, panting in terrible exhaustion, were able to suck
in the air of reviving strength and hold on.  When later
the attacks of February and March came, they were
sporadic, and lacked the fury, the sustained and vehement
driving power of the first assault.  Now in spring, it was too
late, for Nature with sun and gentle breath had definitely
won the battle for the Vaga men, and they crossed the
river to safety, leaving in the black, despairing night, two
villages flaming, a recessional of ill-will and destruction.
</p>

<p>
The first boast of "one Allied soldier against twenty
Bolsheviks" had been made good, and the Expedition was
saved, but by a precariously close margin.  In no respect
did the Allied Command so underestimate the enemy as in
his power of military organization.  The miserable "Bolo
brigands" that were to have disbanded with the first
punishment of Arctic cold, had raised an enormous army, which
now, in late winter, exceeded one million soldiers, and the
regiments that took Shenkurst must have laughed contemptuously
at the undisciplined, untrained troops of the early
days of the campaign.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it will never be known why the Allies were not
destroyed by these Vaga attacks.  There were many
villages capable of housing great numbers of soldiers south
of Shenkurst, and probably in the January thrust, seven
thousand five hundred to eight thousand hostile troops were
quartered in them, a force that should have swept the Vaga
Column before it like chaff in the storming wind, but it
did not do so, and one may conjecture that the reason was
because Trotsky did not care to hazard the risk of stirring
the American people and the British people to an avenging
and genuine war by the annihilation of the lone Allied
battalions.  Greater wars have been brought about by more
trivial causes; but the stronger probability is that the
Bolshevik soldiers revolted at the staggering slaughter of the
attacks over the deep snows.
</p>

<p>
"Our losses are terrible," said one of the prisoners, "the
commissars cannot understand your resistance.  We are
twenty to one and have many guns.  Our Commander expected
to take Bereznik in three days, but the soldiers will
not attack any more over the snow against your awful
machine guns."
</p>

<p>
The troops at the Vaga battles could not be compared
with the unruly, Bolo rabble of the early days.  They shot
low and were well officered by officers, mostly Letts, who
had been trained in Trotsky's military schools at Moscow.
</p>

<p>
Another explanation might have been in the story of
some of the prisoners, but which was never confirmed, that
the soldiers had met in a solemn, protest meeting,
following the last costly, Vaga offensive, and shot their
Commander for his persistence in pushing on, despite the heavy
casualties.  The fatal potion of Kerensky's Order still
poisoned the blood of the Russian army, and although the
Soviet soldiers gave exhibition of great bravery, and were
well led, they were not great soldiers; they failed in the
ultimate trial, and did not go through to victory when
stamina and resilience for the last lap would have won.
</p>

<p>
As the Vaga men had gone furthest in fulfillment of a
vain and futile mission, had parried the heart thrust, and
beat back its violence, so were they the last to leave, and
were still in battle at Malo Bereznik at the close of May,
six months after the Armistice, that proclaimed Peace to
an afflicted World, and poured cooling balm on a million
wounds, so far from feverish, strife torn Russia.
</p>

<p>
Not until June did they meet their regimental comrades,
coming from every compass point of the wide province,
save the seabound, impassable north, to assemble at
Economia for the homegoing.  There the battles of Kodish
and the Railway, Onega, the Vaga and Dvina and Pinega
Valley were fought again, until the white, Russian snows
were hued rose red with blood of recounted slain, until
American soldiers sailed away, bewildered still at this
gambling murder game, and sacred life&mdash;the most contemptible
stake in the mad lottery.
</p>

<p>
Not the Vaga men to idly speculate on causes!  They
knew full well the colonel's words, and were exalted still
by the fervor of their sacrificial avowal, the noblest of
mankind&mdash;to lay down life for a friend.

PINEGA
</p>

<p>
The Orthodox Church of Russia is hated by the Soviets
with an intense and vehement hatred, for the institution
of kings was sustained by religion even more effectively
than by the Imperial Guards.  Therefore, no opportunity
to deride reverend personages and sacred objects is
ever neglected by the Bolsheviks, or to violate with leering
and uncouth pleasure, the hallowed worship places.
</p>

<p>
Under the nimbose influence of Red Moscow, the religious
precepts of the people will be snatched ruthlessly
from them.  Harsh and unyielding though these precepts
be, they are the only note of spirituality in the life of the
moujik, and without them he wallows in a mire of crass
animalism.  There was in Holy Russia many a homily in
patience and honesty and humility; but will these homely
virtues endure in the arid waste and the spiritless air of
agnosticism?
</p>

<p>
At Pinega, some ninety miles east of Archangel (and
nearly one hundred fifty on the devious road), the cleric
party was well fortified, and the outstanding civic feature
of the city was the ancient monastery, standing commandingly
at the edge of Lake Soyla.
</p>

<p>
The Pinega monks were quite naturally opposed to the
Bolsheviks, but the mayor was a Soviet, and the city was
divided in allegiance between White Archangel and Red
Moscow when the detachment of Americans came in
October.
</p>

<p>
The Americans' presence shepherded the wavering ones
to the fold.  A company of Home Guards was organized,
and from outward signs the cause of the Allies had ascended
to triumph.  But the surrounding Bolsheviks were far from
disbanded.  They gathered in much strength under the
leadership of Kulikoff, a competent horsethief, and
commenced to plunder the slender, household larders of the
peasants in the lower Pinega valley, to whose succor a
police force of thirty-five Americans and two hundred
White Russians were dispatched in mid-November.  This
police party penetrated eighty miles southeast and took
Karpagora, after an engagement, but early in December
was overpowered by the returning Bolsheviks.  A few of
the Americans were killed, more wounded, and the rest
went back to Pinega, posting the White Russians in
outlying villages as they retired.
</p>

<p>
So critical was the outlook that another American detachment
came the one hundred and fifty miles from Archangel,
ten days' journey in the darkness and the cold.  But,
more important to Pinega than these Christmas reinforcements,
was Joel R. Moore, who came with them, wearing
the shoulder straps of an infantry captain for the time in
being, but whose life profession was that of college
instruction, as skilled in applied humanity as the classical
Humanities, and possessed of tact and understanding and
sympathy, and that indefinable gift of leadership.  He
organized the Russians for their own defense in this bloody
internecine fight, and shamed their leaders to vivid
consciousness of dreadful responsibility to their pitifully
dependent people.
</p>

<p>
In February, a vicious and prolonged attack in conjunction
with the great Vaga offensive was made on Pinega,
but the defense was well held, and when the situation looked
most strained, and the fall of the city almost sure, the
Bolsheviks slackened and fell back without overt cause or
reason for relenting in their fierce assault, just as they did on
the Vaga when the life of the Expedition was the stake.
</p>

<p>
No soldier who was in it will ever forget that mid-winter
march from Archangel in gray days and cold, when the
spruce trees cracked in the frost with the report of rifle
shots; when the wind, a blearing blast, swept down and
piled great billowy swells on the whitened trail, covered
men head and foot like powdered, clownish figures, plastered
their eyelids and nostrils grotesquely white with hoary
frost, and flicked snow particles under headgear where they
stung with the sting of pelting sand; other days when
oppressive calm would stifle the air with the mystery of
eternal stillness, jarringly profaned by the crunch of heavy,
marching feet, the shambling of the little convoy ponies;
and the tenacious trail would lower to great sheeted space,
that swelled to the summit of long hills where village roofs
were etched in steel on a burnished background, where the
ineffectual sun strove vainly to thrust back imprisoning
cloud curtains, slate hued and black.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the way brought the soldiers through the
phantom glade of a fairy forest, where delicately spun
aigrettes and fragile, filmy plumes held by doubtful tenure
on a limb would wave precariously in the wind and be
lost in shapeless, irretrievable chaos of crumpled snow,
but tens of thousands of others would fill their places, and
inconceivable, bizarre festoons would spring to magic life,
countless balloons and garlands and wreaths, and massive,
ponderous globes, all shaped by the infinite artistry of the
frost in an endless profusion of enchanting wonderment.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes their canopy would be a lilac sea, with islands
of suave saffron, and slender, garish emerald reefs, which
could never escape the tristful quality of the haunting
Russian skies, where tragedy and melodrama ever unfolded till
night clasped in blackness the brief twilight of those
doleful winter days.
</p>

<p>
Under their humble roofs, the patient people revealed
a hospitality that was moving in its utter absence of guile.
The cherished samovar would be brought forth from a
covert trove to kindle the uninvited guests with steaming
tea, and in the evening all the villagers would troop to the
crowded huts to doff their hats and cross themselves with
pious orisons, and gaze with never wearying gaze at the
strangers from the far fabled land of miracle and hope.
Years from now moujik grandmothers will group rapt
children around the oven stoves to tell them of the strange
Americanskis who once came so many miles in the dread
winter cold to help afflicted Russia.
</p>

<p>
Out in the frigid night, the aurora of the north swung
swaying evanescent curtains, now fluttering with faint
ethereal light, now springing to flowing, colorful life again,
and one could fancy that Thalia signaled from the night
heavens a playful spectral heliograph, mocking these silly
little men so far below, that strove to conquer the dread
elements of that gaunt Northland.
</p>

<p>
But, if in the whole campaign the somber veil of tragedy
was ever lifted, it was at this front where the altruistic
intention of the Allies seemed to have caught the consciousness
of the people (whether or not this intent was in fact
altruistic), they bore not only benevolence, but even
humble touching gratitude towards their deliverers, and even
undertook the burden of their own battles.  Many Russians
were lost in these battles for Pinega, but after the first
expeditionary engagements not one American fell.
</p>

<p>
In January there was a massed assault, and when the
fall of the city seemed almost sure, the Bolsheviks slackened
and fell back, with their blade poised for the heart thrust.
</p>

<p>
But in March the defenses were safe in the competent
hands of a regiment of White Russians, who were the
defenders of their own towns, and the "Allied Legion" of
no nation.  Likewise there were two field guns with a
Russian personnel of artillery, a unit of Russian machine
gunners, carefully trained in the service of these rapid,
death-dealing instruments of specialized modern war, and all
these soldiers of Russia raised their heads high and proud
as eagles, wearing no man's collar.
</p>

<p>
So it came that the Americans were free to take their
leave for more pressing fronts and were given "Farewell
and come again" from the hearts of the Pinega people,
with generous, overflowing good will, abounding grateful
acknowledgment of their genuine, upbuilding service.
Perhaps this was more the conceived purpose of the
Expedition to sustain the foundling democracy of Russia, to
strengthen and instill solidarity and faith in the hearts and
counsels of the Russian people, and to achieve such end
by unsanguinary means.  Perhaps the means might have
been different and the melodrama never enacted if a
college professor, with methods of applied humanity, had
directed from the outset.  But it is to offend the military
to consider thus, and to be guilty of shameful heterodoxy.

<p class="intro">
"There is no use people raising prejudice against

It was sent as part of our operations against Germany.
It was vitally necessary to take every measure in
regard to Russia during the war which would keep as
many German troops as possible on the Russian front,
and reduce that formidable movement of the German
armies which carried more than a million men to the
Western Front, and which culminated in that immense

RETREAT
</p>

<p>
When the appeal to patriotism failed, Archangel
Province, under British direction, invoked conscription,
and by the middle of June, twenty-two thousand
Russian soldiers had been assembled by coercive means.
</p>

<p>
They thronged the backward villages through which the
Americans passed on their way to disembarkation, and
looked very fresh, like college youths, as they sauntered
up and down to an eternal serenade of wheezing accordions,
or with sacerdotal, marching chants, went swinging by in
platoons and companies, these young conscripts, who knew
so little of war and its harrowing disillusionment.
</p>

<p>
For the moment all breasts were filled with that
contagious ardor that springs from every massed effort, no
matter its end, but not one in a hundred knew or felt the
call of patriotism for the coming conflict of Russian against
Russian.
</p>

<p>
There was cause enough for the fight had it only been
revealed to these pliant, guileless, peasant folk.  For their
country, weakened, helpless and faint from many war
wounds, was being debased by vile and vicious poltroons
who had stamped out the holy fires of the Revolution,
nullified the Constituent Assembly, and stifled every voice
of liberty with hands more remorseless than the cruel
manacles of the Tsars.
</p>

<p>
The cause was there, but if their mentors sensed it, they
manifested almost incredible obtuseness in failure to
impart these moving eloquent reasons for the fight.  They
were silent about the odious exploitation of the masses
under the crafty, artful guise of proletarianism; they said
nothing of the wicked violation of sacred property rights,
the unprincipled plundering, the trampling down by power
maddened feet on all revolutionary enlightenment, the
desecration of all things spiritual, the wanton derision of the
church which had been the faith of the people and of their
venerated, sainted fathers.
</p>

<p>
Here was reason enough for any Russian with exalted,
holy devotion to lay down his life for his stricken country.
But instead of such scathing and unequivocal indictment,
the British dwelt upon the conduct of the Bolsheviks,
shameful and faithless towards the Czecho-Slovaks, and
gave out, with venomous vituperation, highly colored
stories of enemy atrocities and cruel treatment of prisoners
so patently over-extended that they failed to make a
convincing impression even on the moujik mind.
</p>

<p>
So soon as navigation opened, there commenced an exodus
of Russian officers to Archangel, sent by the British
Command to lead the newly formed native legions.  These
officers came from the old Imperial Army, many were titled,
proud of their high birth, and by every thought and training,
and by every instinct, irreconcilably opposed to every
notion of social equality; in short, irredentists of that
heartless, arrogant, military class which a worn afflicted world
had cast off in a travail of four years' agony and afflicting
grief, and long suffering Russia had driven forever from
her temples.
</p>

<p>
So the fresh formed conscript ranks were made
conveniently vulnerable for Bolshevik propaganda, this new
weapon of warfare, invisible and treacherous, that on the
Eastern Front had scored such havoc with the boasted
discipline of the Germans.  Soviet agents were everywhere,
mingling with the people on the streets of Archangel,
wearing the khaki of the newly organized soldiers, living with
them, going through their drills, and fatigue and exercises,
and ever with the passionate zeal of fanatics, feeding them
the poisonous doctrines of Reddest Moscow, ceaselessly,
night and day.
</p>

<p>
Now the innuendo was very plausible that these aristocrats
of the Old School had returned to restore the Romanoffs,
and that the British capitalists were leagued with them
for the conquest of Russia and the enslavement of the
common people.  It was easy to argue that the British, always
interested in the trading possibilities of Archangel, had
come to exploit its resources.  Otherwise why should they
be so vitally concerned in this civil war of Russians?
British officers were freely mingled with these Imperial officers,
British Intelligence supervising the staff work and dispositions,
and a liberal spreading of reliable British N.C.O.'s
among the ranks, to keep a watchful eye on things and
bolster the recruits in the stern trial of first battle.
</p>

<p>
The great majority of the British officers had no appetite
for the business ahead.  They were tired and homesick,
weary and fed up with war for all time after four racking
years of it.  Moreover, they disliked everything Russian
with a withering aversion, and in their forced association
with the Russians, treated them with a disdainful condescension
and that impersonal, inhuman lack of tolerance which
is British beyond all imitation.  Openly they distrusted
their allied comrades, and sometimes when tired and
irritable and nerve frayed, they said so, which did not make
towards the establishment of an enthusiastic and permanent
entente, for the educated Slav is an accomplished linguist,
and sometimes he understood and did not easily forget
when he was abused in English, and vehemently cursed as
a "bloody Bolo."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It had been determined before the opening of navigation
that all American forces should be withdrawn and the
campaign abandoned.  The reason for this was not revealed
to the troops just as the cause of the Expedition had never
been mentioned, and every man in American uniform sensed
a gaping moral void on the part of his Country.  Certain
death from the Bolsheviks awaited those loyal Russians
who had placed their trust in the promised salvation of
the Allied leaders and the American authorities at least
seemed blind to their manifest duty to the Archangel
government.  It was an awkward situation for the statesmen,
but unavoidable under the circumstances&mdash;and Archangel
was a long distance removed from Washington.  Anyway,
the British held on&mdash;they would have to attend to uncomfortable
details.  We were going to clear out, and clear out
we did.
</p>

<p>
The problem of evacuation was a disturbing one.  There
was a clamor in England as insistent as that which echoed
from America to get out of Russia and get out without
delay.  This might have been done, and the British might
have abandoned these thousands of Russian people who,
trusting in the courage, the steadfastness, and the honor
of the Allies, had cast their lot with them for better or for
worse.  But, instead of deserting the country without
ceremony as we did, a frank disclosure of the situation was
made to the press in England, and a call was issued for
volunteers to rescue British soldiers at Archangel.  A mixed
brigade of venturesome men who were wearied by peace
time tedium and longed again for the thrill of war, and
others who were out of work and could get no other
employment, was raised by this method, but to muster the
full quota for relief it was necessary to add a like number
of Regulars, in all approximately eight thousand men.
Each brigade had two infantry battalions, units of artillery,
airplanes, machine gun corps and engineers, and the
first echelon, commanded by Brigadier General G. W. Grogan,
Victoria Cross, reached Archangel at the end of May.
The rest, under Brigadier L. W. Sadleir Jackson, came on
the 10th June, and the ships that brought them carried
away the Americans.
</p>

<p>
To the civil mind an evacuation, especially by sea, seems
a simple matter.  The civilian thinks of it merely as a
packing off to the ships, disregarding the losses involved
to make short shift and get away.  But in complicated,
modern war, there are countless perplexing details in the
final movement of an army.  Massive, ponderous ordnance
and munitions and supplies must be assembled with prodigious
labor, transported or destroyed.  And it is necessary
to hold the enemy off till the last retreating file has mounted
the gang plank and put off far to sea.  Also, in the case of
Archangel, it was an involved problem to attend to the
civilian population.
</p>

<p>
The British government laid open the offer to transport
every Archangel resident apprehensive of the Bolsheviks,
and to provide employment for them in other lands.  It
was expected that vast numbers would avail themselves
of this opportunity and would flee from the approaching
reign of horrors, but when the time came only sixty-five
hundred and thirty-five came forward for expatriation, and
these were all sent to South Russia and the Baltic States.
</p>

<p>
When all was in readiness, General Ironside planned to
safeguard the retreat by administering a sharp "disengaging
blow," like Sir John Moore dealt the French at Corunna
one hundred years before, which would shake the enemy's
morale and disabuse him of any notion of following the
retreating troops to the waterside.
</p>

<p>
The Czechs had fused with Admiral Kolchak's armies.
Under the leadership of General Gaida, they formed his
right wing and were beyond Perm, some three hundred
miles east of Viatka.  It was thought that these friendly
Siberian forces could take Viatka, advance up the railway
to Kotlas, and join there with the Archangel Russians.
Thereupon the British, leisurely and in security, could
return down the river to the waiting transports and sail
homeward.
</p>

<p>
So Kotlas, which had been the original objective of the
River Column, became the objective once more.  The
Admiralty dispatched to Archangel a flotilla of gunboats,
monitors, mine sweepers and many other craft for the
transportation of troops and supplies to act as auxiliaries for
the infantry, and again the Dvina became a scene of
skeltering preparations for war.
</p>

<p>
On the 20th June, the disengaging offensive began; the
British and Archangel troops attacked across the river from
the Allied position at Toulgas, and gained complete victory,
capturing two hundred prisoners, many machine guns and
three field guns.  But now word came from the south that
the Bolsheviks there had concentrated in great forces against
Kolchak and had utterly routed him, that he was fleeing
east, had already retired as far as Yetakerinburg, and all
hope would have to be given up of effecting a junction
with the Siberian army.
</p>

<p>
So the importance of taking Kotlas waned, but even if
Kolchak had not failed the advance could have gone little
further, for it was found that due to the light snowfall of
the previous winter, the waters of Dvina were low, beyond
all precedent, and the British flotilla could follow no
farther upstream.
</p>

<p>
Most discouraging of all, treachery broke out in all
quarters from the allied Russian troops.  On the 7th July a
battalion held in reserve on the river mutinied in the night
and murdered three British and four Russian officers as
they slept; four other officers were seriously wounded.  On
the 22nd July the whole Onega detachment went over to
the Bolsheviks, and the safety of Archangel became
seriously jeopardized from this west port.  Nearly at the same
time British firing squads suppressed a revolt on the
Railway front before the Russian mutineers gained the upper
hand.
</p>

<p>
Many of the British officers had passed through all the
harrowing fires of France, but here was a form of peril new
in the experience of the most hardened ones&mdash;base
betrayal by the sentinel who kept the black watches of the
night, and treachery in the heart of the citadel from hands
stretched forth in friendship.  The brave man, standing
on his feet and facing the end, does not fear advancing
death; but now it lurked in hiding, it descended in the night
and struck from the dark upon unconscious sleep, so that
tired soldiers dared not rest, and the strain snapped nerves
of steel.
</p>

<p>
A few weeks before these outrages, Toulgas was given
over to a defense that was entirely Russian.  Shortly
afterward, in the uncertain light of early morning, on the 25th
April, there was a wild commotion, and, following
interminable confused firing that sounded from all quarters of
the village streets, a lamp message flashed across the Dvina
to the Allied position at Kurgoman: "We are completely
surrounded; the Bolos are attacking in five places."  Shortly
thereafter, through a fusillade of bullets, a Russian
officer, with two men, effected a passage of the river in a small
boat, and told the shameful story of how nine officers had
been murdered as they slept and bloody Toulgas delivered
by faithless Russian soldiers to the waiting Bolsheviks in
the woods.  Through a prodigy of bravery by a handful
of loyal artillery men, the guns were pulled back to
Shusiga, ten miles downstream, but it was not until the middle
of May that Toulgas was retaken, and while it stayed in
enemy hands, the Allied position was alarmingly critical
with the right flank over the Dvina completely turned.
</p>

<p>
Thus, with mutiny breaking out in all quarters, the
virulent propaganda of the Bolsheviks bore malignant fruit
beyond their most sanguine hopes, and the situation was
menacing enough to alarm the most conservative in Allied
Councils.  Had it not been for the two splendid reinforcing
brigades, the often imperiled life of the Expedition
would have been destroyed at last.  The British War Office
for once became thoroughly apprehensive.  General, Lord
Rawlinson was sent to preside over the leavetaking, and
fresh reinforcements, two battalions of infantry, two
machine gun companies, two batteries of Royal Field Artillery,
one engineer company, and five tanks were rushed to
Archangel from England.
</p>

<p>
The intention had been to complete the evacuation just
before the closing of navigation in late October, but now
it was seen that this might be too late, and in the present
urgency no time could be lost.  "The disengaging blow"
was delivered on the 10th August by Jackson's sterling
brigade, a little beyond Seltzo, the furthermost south
achieved on the Dvina by the little River Column almost
a year before.  Two thousand prisoners were captured,
eighteen guns and many machine guns, and the rout was
complete.  With the enemy now safely at bay, the British
turned the defenses over to the Archangel authorities, who
persisted in staying, although they were advised that it was
suicidal to do so, and "friendly intervention" was brought
to an inglorious, albeit an unbloody, close on the 27th
September, eleven months after the Armistice that had
outlawed the rule of warring strife as the arbitrament of
discordant nations.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When the last troop ships trailed off to drooping skies,
a bearded moujik sat in the stern of a flat boat directing
four broad backed women at the oars.  The recumbent
coxswain waved a languid gesture across Archangel Bay
where tiny ships were bearing off to the north; and four
oars poised in mid-air as the laboring crew turned with dull
Slavic contemplation to regard the parting foreigners, and
the end of their peculiar expedition.  But only for a
moment, there was more important business in hand than idle
gazing at Englishskis, however queer they might be.  A
gruff command, and the freighted craft continued its slow
toiling course to the market place, the overlord resumed his
interrupted smoke of good Allied cigarettes and the
Englishskis were dismissed from memory.  This was the
leave-taking.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of 12th October, 1919, the last of the
Allied forces set sail from Murmansk for England; four
months afterward, on the 20th February, the Bolsheviks
recaptured Archangel.
</p>

<p>
Nearly four months earlier the last of the Americans set
sail on the 26th day of June, 1919, and as the paling shores
mingled with the distant sky line and faded from sight, so
too the fever of this troublous, little war with Russia
abated, yielding to the gentle ministrations of memory's
cooling twilight.
</p>

<p>
With the Americans, at least, there remained no shred
of illusion.  When Winston Churchill told the Commons
that Archangel, with one lone American regiment, the few
battle retrieved soldiers of England, and a single battalion
of disaffected Frenchmen, had kept many German divisions
in the East, and played an important part in the last battles,
he laid a flattering unction to the soul of British
statescraft; but his insincere words did not deceive the American
soldier, for the American soldier was mentally and
emotionally paralyzed beyond deception, and a conviction of
blunder was only strengthened by this and other clumsy
explanations vouchsafed by Allied statesmen; by the
guilt-laden silence of America.
</p>

<p>
Germany was never concerned with Archangel.  There
was no evidence of German participation in the campaign;
no evidence that our petty hostilities with the Bolsheviks
had ever benefited Foch on the Western theater.
</p>

<p>
We had waged war upon Russia.  Whether willfully or
unwillingly, our country had engaged in an unprovoked
intensive, inglorious, little armed conflict which had ended
in disaster and disgrace.  Perhaps this was a laudable thing
to do.  Perhaps it is always idealistic and praiseworthy to
intervene for self-conceived righteousness in the internal
affairs of another nation, as England might have done in
the case of the American Confederacy, and as we did in
the case of this civil war among the Russians.  It is easy
enough to enter the battle lists, but, once in, it is not so
easy to withdraw from the fight with self-respect unsullied
and honor undefiled.
</p>

<p>
So Archangel proved, with its sullied record to blight
forever the good name of America when soldiers gather to
tell of the Great War, and, great as the cost of the campaign
had been with 2,485 casualties[<a id="chap11fn1text"></a><a href="#chap11fn1">1</a>] of killed and wounded
and sickened men, its financial loss, over ten times the
price paid Russia for the vast dominions of Alaska, there
was not a man in the ranks who did not sense the disgrace
in our ignoble desertion, there was not an American officer
who would not have chosen to have left his bones bleaching
white beneath Archangel snows, than been a living witness
to the ignominious way in which his country quit and
slunk away.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
All felt a personal sense of poignant shame for the
failure to see the game through to its uttermost bitter end,
or else seek expiation by honest avowal of wrong and
humble contrition.  It was an inexorable dilemma, one that
took the staunchest courage, no matter which course was
followed.  Perhaps the higher courage would have been
the admission of culpable fault.  But we took neither
course.  We merely wilted from Archangel and came away.
</p>

<p>
On the homeward troopships, among the ice floes of the
White Sea, the taunting unspoken reproach galled most
bitterly of all, for we left our British allies to extricate
themselves from the miserable mess as best they could, and
with no explanation and never a sustaining word we left
them.
</p>

<p>
Many trying things in the campaign had aroused the
Americans to intemperate speech, which now to recall they
would have surrendered all they possessed.  Incompetence
and tactlessness, and seeming lack of understanding and
sympathy by those in power, to which the soldiers of
England appeared indifferent, never failed to draw the intense,
iconoclastic fire of the Americans.  The difference lay in
the national atmosphere of the two countries, the divergence
in character and traditions, born and nurtured under the
republican and the older order.  They are a different people
from us, the British, though the blood strain be the same.
The glory of baseball is lost on them; they play the tedious
cricket; but, when the fight is on, the quality of the
bulldog, once at grips to hang on with set teeth till death, is
British; blinded to all save the solid grimness of the task
in hand, their brains seem dull to those imaginative flights
which are the curse of the Western soldier.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Thus ended America's share of the war with Russia.  At
Brest the "mutinous" regiment was shunted in fragments
over the seas to America, and in the homeland, these soldiers
who had borne arms in conflict six months after the Armistice,
were shooed off to civilian life, and the whole
embarrassing matter was expunged from the war record.
</p>

<p>
All inquiry concerning the Expedition has been met by
specious pleas in evasive avoidance.  No peace was ever
made with Russia, as no state of war had ever been
recognized, and the legalists might well contend that all who
engaged in it are open to indictment for manslaughter, for
the enterprise will always remain a depraved one with
status of a freebooters' excursion.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At Corbela sat an aged woman with ghastly face, gray
as the dirty <i>platok</i> that framed it, her gaunt chin resting
on a hand, bony and hideous from relentless toil.  With
failing despairing eyes, she saw in the dwindling snows
only the dissolution of winter, quite blinded to buoyant
spring that with tufts of brown turf bursts boisterously
through the southern hill slopes, like heedless youth that
with surging, eager, passionate desire presses on the
reluctant heels of death to life's fulfillment.
</p>

<p>
Outside the hut a young moujik, with the handsome
physique of first unsullied manhood, and the credulous eyes
of a child, curiously watching the north marching Americans;
a giant of masked strength, needing only the key of
trained intelligence to unloose immeasurable dynamic force
that might some day rule the world.
</p>

<p>
Kindle the liberating torch of enlightenment in the
nether regions of the Slavs, strike from the millions the
shackles of serfdom ignorance, and from the pestilential
ashes of present degrading Bolshevism, Russia, the giant,
in stupendous power, rises phoenixlike to Jupiter.
</p>

<p>
To the Russian people we owe a debt that can never be
paid except in deepest and very humble gratitude; for,
when those gray hosts swept over Belgium and Northern
France, Russia invaded Prussia, threatened the gates of
Koenigsberg, routed the Austrians in a smashing blow at
Lemberg, and, when the German aggressive movement was
at its culminating height, drew off to the east two Army
Corps and a Cavalry Division from von Kluck's right wing,
a fatal diversion of the German forces which enabled Joffre,
closing in the breach at the Marne, to save Paris and turn
the advance into a complete retirement.
</p>

<p>
This great battle of the Marne marked the initial phase
of the war, and completely frustrated the cherished Berlin
plan of gaining quick victory by tactics of overwhelming
surprise.
</p>

<p>
Many anxious months followed as England slowly transformed
her energies from peaceful pursuits to those of war,
and during this prolonged, crucial time the Russians never
wavered from the attack.  They massed for repeated
hammering offensives in Poland, in Masturia and east of the
Vistula in Galicia, so that the German Imperial Staff could
never develop full strength, but had to be content with a
holding campaign in the West while marshalling most forces
to oppose the menacing East.
</p>

<p>
Not until the beginning of 1916, because of the Russians,
could another effort of masses be made.  Then every
available man was concentrated with the Crown Prince's
army as he smashed at Verdun to bring France to her knees,
but when the assault was at its height, again obedient to
her trust, and faithful, Russia sprang to the attack with
such heroism and such devoted and reckless courage, that
the controlling German combat divisions which might have
gained the fortress had to be diverted from Verdun to
Galicia.
</p>

<p>
Yet again at the commencement of 1917, at Mitau, and,
in the summer of that year, when the British Empire
assembled its legions at the Somme, Brussiloff struck south
to the Carpathian passes, and it was only when Russia
collapsed exhausted, and ghoulish Bolshevism looted the
prostrate stricken gladiator, that the united German armies
marshalled in full strength for a crushing blow.  <i>Only then
did Germany have numerical superiority in the West</i>.
</p>

<p>
We can gain an impression of what might have happened
from the fury of that La Fere-Arras offensive, which
shocked the world by its blighting trail of spectral horrors;
hardly a British Division was left intact, and France reeled
and staggered in a nausea of mortal weakness until Clemenceau
in agony cried out to the Allies for sustaining support.
</p>

<p>
All might have ended then, had it not been for America,
but America could never have come, had it not been for
the Russian sacrifice in the early days, when the German
Divisions, fresh and recklessly rash, were filled with the
lust of battle conquest, and the German leaders, careless
of casualties, flung their men to death with a high and free
hand.
</p>

<p>
It is well to remember these things when we boast (a
little noisily) that American arms won the great war.  No
one nation won this appalling contest of the nations
embattled at Esdraelon, and, great as our offering was, how
small it was and how feebly comparable to that of Russia
who laid down the lives of more men than all we sent to
France, and paid a ghastly toll in crippled, maimed and
battle losses, a million souls beyond the sum of our whole
military effort!

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
